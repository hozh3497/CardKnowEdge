# CardKnowlEdge
The project I built during Insight Data Science 2020A

This app is designed to help entry level credit card users get a structured view of the issues that experienced users have, how they maximize the values of their credit card points, and what the questions to ask when deciding whether to open a new line of credit.
The data are pulled from posts in Flyertalk's credit card forum.
