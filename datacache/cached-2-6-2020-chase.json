What they actually mean is proof of financial responsibility. There is actually no law mandating how you need to pay for the damages if you are found to be responsible. Cash, insurance, credit card, etc. No one really cares as soon as it has been paid. Bottom line, when the Enterprise agent really means financial responsibility, you are thinking liability coverage.

Besides, CDW isn't liability insurance, so Enterprise isn't exactly in the wrong here.", "No such assumption has been made. In fact, I am merely using CA as an example why people equate insurance with proof of financial responsibility. Beside - many requirements are actually universal among states, like NY or TX.

I am planning to rent a car in Malaysia and I can't seem to confirm whether car rental insurance is mandatory by government regulations or not. The car rental agency includes \"standard hire &amp; drive insurance\" as part of the base rate, which basically appears to be a plan where I'm on the hook for the excess in the event of a collision. The excess can be further reduced if I buy additional coverage. The agency seems to refer to the basic plan as the \"standard hire &amp; drive insurance\" and CDW interchangeably per the snip I attached. In this case, would CSR not cover the excess even it's included as part of the base rate? From what I'm reading here, it appears that offering the plan as part of the base rate isn't enough and that it has to be mandated by the government for the coverage to kick in as a secondary.

I took pictures of front and back of original rental agreement and also accident report, and of course the damage.  Highly recommend doing this.  I also filed a police report (see below) July 21: end of trip, returned new car.  Charge for the car rental sat as pending for a loooooooong time, then eventually posted as a higher amount.  Checked my bill and I was charged for FRANCHISE REDUITE for EUR 115 and I was also charged for returning my (broken) car without a full tank.  Took picture of front and back of new rental agreement. Jul 23: Started the claim process with eclaimsline to make sure I was within deadline, but didn't upload any documents.  Got an email saying I had to supply all the needed documents with 365 days.  They wanted a Demand Letter, Final Rental Agreement, and cc bill showing the charges. Aug 14: Filed Hertz inquiry asking if there would be any additional charges and asking what EUR 115 for FRANCHISE REDUITE was on my bill. Aug 27: Hertz wrote back saying the EUR 115 was for damage and that Hertz France would be getting back to me soon with more info and to direct further inquires to [email\u00a0protected] .  I didn't want to finalize my claim because I was worried there would be additional charges coming at me. Oct 22: Hertz France wrote back saying EUR 115 was from their damage matrix and included scans of the accident report, the rental agreement, and their damage matrix.  They didn't explicitly say there would be no more charges but I felt more confident that they had evaluated the damage and chosen to charge me this much. Oct 22: I replied to last eclaimsline email and attached accident report, new and old rental agreements, picture of damage, police report, bill from Hertz, email from Hertz saying that FRANCHISE REDUITE was for damages, and all the scans they had sent me, along with credit card statement showing the charge and last 4 digits. Oct 24: Notified by eclaimsline that my claim for EUR 115 had been approved.  I couldn't get the direct deposit option to work so they will send me a check. Extremely satisfied with Chase here, with only 2-day turnaround on the claim once they had the documents.  Extremely frustrated that the Hertz bill didn't just say what the charge was for and that they took almost 2 months to get back to a simple inquiry. Note on police report: This rental was in France and the car window was smashed overnight and personal belongings stolen.  I called the police and was told to go to the station to make a report.  I went to the police station and they had me fill out the multi-lingual report form, made we wait 2 hours, then told me (in fairly good English) that if I didn't speak French they would have to set me up with an appointment with a translator, for later that day, at a different station.  Since I had spoken 0 words of French to them the whole time I don't know why they waited 2 hours to tell me this. I took the intervening time to return my car to Hertz and get a new one, since there seemed a 0% chance they were going to collect any evidence from the car.  The check-in employee filled out an accident report form and gave me a form to go get a new car from the counter. Then back to the police station to file a report, took over an hour, basically the translator read my form out loud to a police officer who typed it in very slowly.  All in all I spent 4 hours in police stations to get a 3-page report and some good stories from the translator, while we were waiting for the officer. In retrospect I probably wouldn't have wasted half a day making the police report if I'd known it would only be EUR 115 and that it would take 6 hours total plus some hefty parking fees near the police station.  Was thinking at the time that the damage might be more like EUR 500 and that I would also file a homeowner's insurance claim for some of the stolen property (later decided not to, once we had sorted out what was stolen), so for EUR ~1000 seemed worth spending what I thought would be an hour or two getting the police report.  Didn't turn out that way. If I was doing it again for &lt;$200 I would definitely just exchange with Hertz, file the insurance claim without the police report (not even clear they needed it), and if it was denied just pay out of pocket.

When it is government mandated CDW coverage, Chase would cover the excess, PROVIDED you do NOT buy it down. The information you quoted, looks like Malaysia has mandatory CDW coverage with high excess, and the rental car company entices you to buy down the excess - once you do that, you LOSE any credit card coverage, be it Chase or Citi or AMEX. Note the key words of Nonwaivable,  (for the coverage), as well as \"buy down\" the excess which does not look buy it down much because you are still responsible for anywhere from 50% to 70% of the original excess! The excess is the maximum you would have to pay when you incur damages.  Usually the rental car company would charge that upfront, then you file claim to get most of it back if the claim is approved.  The excess itself ONLY for the actual repair cost, BEFORE taxes / excise fees / airport surcharges etc.  Those can be additional 30 to 40% of the excess.  Not all the add-on items are covered.  Airport surcharge on repair estimate is specifically NOT covered per the T&amp;Cs of benefits. Quote:", "Thanks.  I looked at Avis and it just says that it is included in the rate (not declinable), so it looks like basic CDW with excess is mandatory - other competitors like EuropCar also describe premium CDW as an excess reducing plan.   Since it looks like it is mandatory/nonwaivable, I guess the CSR CDW should kick in as a secondary.  Will sharing that screenshot with Chase be enough to prove that it is mandatory?", "You do NOT need to do anything.  The insurance provider KNOWS which country has mandatory CDW and process your claim accordingly.  Or if you still feel the need, you can google such as Does Malaysia require mandatory CDW coverage on rental car?  something like that and see what you can find and print.  Personally I would not be bothered. I have posted a very detailed report on a claim from our May 2018 trip at Sicily where we had some bad scratches to the car.  Italy is a mandatory CDW country, and is excluded from AMEX coverage in case you are not aware of this.  Chase covered the 1000 euro excess plus taxes and even paid a portion of the not-covered airport surcharges on the 1000 euro.  Go back to last year correspondent period to find my report - that should give anyone a very good idea on how to file eClaim (Chase's insurance handler) efficiently.  Our claim was settled extremely swiftly - from filing to money ACHed to our bank account, it took only 7 business days.  eClaim did not ask any extra doc nor even communicate to us after filing - the next email we received was to ask how we would like the money be paid.  (direct deposit via ACH or a check sent) One of the Key to have quick settlement is due to Budget at Catania airport being very efficient in processing the return, charge on the damage, and the supporting documents - all done within 10 min, with the docs emailed to us while we were in the return lot.  Then we spent 20 min back at the counter to get the Final Rental Agreement (required to file the claim) as well as to make sure the charges were all billed in Euro, not being DCCed to USD.  eClaim paid the exact amount of Budget's Damage Repair Invoice.", "Trying to figure out if my partner is covered.

Everything went fine until my last evening there when the wind was gusting up to 75 mph. At one of my final stops of the trip I happened to park in a way that the wind was blowing directly into the back of the vehicle so when I opened the door the wind caught it and slammed it forward causing damage. After that the door could only about 1/3rd of the way and even then with a bit of difficulty. The next morning I left about an hour earlier than I would have to get to Keflavik with enough time to fill out whatever I would need to fill out. Returning the car was fairly smooth and the agent handling the return made sure to give me email and hard copies of everything. On the layover on the way home I started the claim and submitted everything hoping for a speedy resolution. However, Card Benefit Services kept asking me to resubmit my rental voucher and contract claiming that the voucher I had submitted did not match. OK, I sent it again, and again, and again. I lost count but I think they asked for it a total of about 4 or 5 times. At this point I was getting frustrated and just decided to forget about it for a few weeks then tried again finally getting an approval. I'm not sure but I had made the booking using Auto Europe and I believe that there might have been an issue in that the actual rental contract showed Auto Europe's corporate account number even though I had used my CSR. I normally try to book directly but this time I could only seem to get this particular rate using the Auto Europe site.

But I do want to know if the basic insurance liability will cover the other parties vehicle? In the event that the basic insurance isn't enough, it'll be out of pocket on my end? Also, there seems to be an option for additional CDW and also protection for windshields, tires, and headlights. I plan to decline the additional CDW, but wanted to opt in for protection of windshields, tires, and headlights.

If you run into problems filing a claim later on, you can always send the letter you received along with the other required documents.", "Chase is very willing to issue a letter regarding the coverage.  Regarding countries where mandatory CDW is required by laws, Chase covers the excess.  We had one such claim at Italy, at Sicily to be exact.  I have posted the details last year - it was 7 calendar days from time to file the claim with eClaims online to the money ACHed to our bank account.  We even got reimbursed a little bit more because in the Repair Cost Estimate there were some airport surcharge added - this item is NOT covered, per the T&amp;Cs. At the time of picking up the car, Budget counter rep asked whether we would buy extra coverage to lower the excess which was $1000 euro before taxes.  We said no because the CC would cover it.  He then said, you understood that you would need to pay this first then you claimed it back from your credit card?  We answered it affirmative.  No more conversation on additional coverage topic. I also dont think in countries where the basic CDW is required by laws you could decline the basic coverage.  You can definitely decline the push to buy down the excess.  What the tactics some rental companies employed were to scare you on how high the excess would be, like up to the value of the car that kind of things, or tens of thousands of $.  This type of practice seems to be more prevailing with the non-worldwide chain, i.e. their names you never know about until you search car rental in that particular country.  Worldwide companies like Avis/Budget/Hertz/National/Enterprise, tend not to use such tactics even at franchisee locations.

Are there legitimate alternatives that might work better for an individual, or are we just mad at the change? To me, it seems like jumping to the Citi ecosystem is a knee-jerk reaction. If the math works out for you, then it works. However, the 4th night free is extremely overrated (even more so if you have a bunch of hotel credit cards) and the effective annual fee is still $245 (same as the CSR). If you spend a lot in air travel and restaurants (which it doesn't sound like you do) then it might be the card for you. I just can't get behind this card. While we all want 5x bonus categories, I feel this card does it to make up for the weak overall value it presents. If I was to move anywhere, it would probably be to the AMEX Gold. For me, while disappointing, one of the main reasons I chose the CSR is because I get many times the value back of what I put into it quite easily. CFU, CIC, and CF all bring some big returns that the CSR can't do on its own and that you aren't getting elsewhere. For example, I almost spend as much a year on cell phone, cable, and streaming services (all 5X) than I do on airfare, and that's even after greatly scaling back on those services.  I am not one who likes all of the effort and choices required to redeem credits and stuff. I get that. It was one of the primary reasons I did not go to the AMEX system. However, I will absolutely offset quite a bit with the Lyft benefits. I hate doordash, but I'm sure I can find something. It isn't end of UR for me just yet.", "I have also been wondering about whether to keep the CSR next year when my renewal comes due.  The card has been good for me-- I spend a significant amount each year on travel and restaurants, and have been able to take advantage of the PP membership since i'm often travelling international economy.   I'm also a great customer for Chase, since I tend to put most of my spend on the card (not just travel and restaurants), so they're making out on the interchange fees on my non bonused spend.  What I'm no longer sure about is the value of the points I'm acquiring-- in general it has been getting harder to find decent valued award redemptions, and I've been hearing that the chase travel portal doesn't offer the full range of choices that one would find on expedia or some similar engine.  That said, my preliminary looking around isn't making me feel like there's another card that would be better-- certainly there are some decent offerings from citi and amex, but then you're locked into their travel portals or their set of transfer partners as well.  The effect of the $100 fee increase has been for me to think more closely about the value I'm getting from the card, and whether I should be looking at alternatives.  As one of the previous posters mentioned, it isn't enough to eliminate the value of the CSR, but does start to make some of the competitors look more competitive...", "Probably just use CSP instead of CSR with my CF, CFU, and Aspire.  If I was going to change to something else, AmEx Everyday Preferred seems like it would fit my spending pretty well.  Would have to do more research.", "Quote: Sorry, was only allowed 5 posts every 24 hours. To respond to the first one, Yes, the Amex is hard to use and doesn't have primary car insurance, but CSP does have it and that is why I am choosing downgrading csr to csp, downgrade ink preferred to ink cash + freedom or downgrade csr to freedom unlimited and use freedom + ink preferred As to the second quote, yes, I love using PP in asia and europe but PP out of LAX sucks, they don't let people into PP lounge after 7 or 8pm for the past 3 times I flew.  I'm not too worried about the lounge access because I also have the amex aspire that provides it, and I used the annual free night + 250 resort credit and the diamond status.

That's why I am considering csr down to csp, ink preferred downgrade to ink cash +freedom or csr to freedom unlimited and keep ink preferred + freedom.

They have sure marketed the heck out of this card. So I would assume it is profitable where it is at. Remember, it's really only an effective 2.5% return on travel and dining (I get some of the transfer partner stuff). There's not a whole lot here to make this card unprofitable for Chase.

Hi all, due to the new annual fee increase. I am thinking of either downgrading the CSR to freedom unlimited and keep the other freedom card + ink preffered combo, or should I downgrade CSR to CSP, downgrade ink preffered to ink cash + use freedom (ink cash actually gets 5% on cables and phone bills and 2% gas n restaurants, ink only gets 3% on travel and phone bills etc). The other thing I am also worrying about is that I get a feeling the CSP's annual fee might also be going up to go against the AMEX gold. It's either that or I will be moving all my trio to citi.

But now I hardly travel twice a year and I have other cards as amex hilton aspire which also gives pp lounge access, ink preferred, both old and new ihg cards, marriott premier and hyatt card. I also feel like that if chase wants to match with amex, at least also give some sort of hotel or airline status, even though most of us already have status through some of the cobrand cards, but it would at least be an easier feeling for me.  So csp literally earns only 1 point less on travel and dining, but the annual fee is much lower and i can still transfer points.

I spend a good bit on travel, which multiplies the rewards. I mostly fly economy, and book through the Chase portal (if I have UR points available), so I benefit from the 1.5x UR point value.

I think they should be marketing these premium cards to people who will travel internationally, I look at JetBlue as a budget US airline. Don't get me wrong, I fly Spirit, Southwest and Frontier if I can or need to but I don't need a card that collects points for these airlines. In closing, a premium card, perhaps one that requires CPC membership and gives some great hotel status and private airline lounges like the UA clubs and Id probably be all in at $1-1500k depending on the details.

But for a much lower fee they offer live advisors that pretty much replicate the CPC advisor experience (and investing strategy) for a fraction of the cost. CPC is not a true private bank either compared to the services offered to high net worth clients at First Republic, Mellon, not to mention JPM clients with $10MM+  And of course not even close to Swiss private banking. CPC is the poor man's version of a private bank designed to lure clients below JPM requirements but who have $250K to invest.  Here's what I value as a CPC customer (in order of value): Manage IRA accounts (cookie cutter generic index funds decided by some team in NYC) including periodic rebalancing (Schwab,Fidelity,Vanguard all have tools that do the same thing) Financial planning (i.e. projecting retirement income and expenses) No ATM, forex or checking overdraft fees (also free @schwab) Free safe deposit box No HELOC fees  Culture Access card (mostly gutted since original rollout)  What I don't get - and need - is a turnkey advisor that will manage every single one of my accounts including 401k, trust accounts, insurance, stock options, etc. Also have yet to find a reputable advisor that understands global diversification, i.e. investing in overseas real estate, offshore accounts. Quote:   Bingo! I'm sure that's true for most of us in this hobby. We are happy to pay AFs but only for TANGIBLE benefits that provide real quantifiable value.$300 in travel credits (that I receive every year on my first statement) = tangible value. Free admission to United Clubs that I probably use 10-20x per year = some tangible value (I value it but I would never pay to enter a UC). Monthly Uber credits = some tangible value but I use Uber sporadically so would never max out. Marriott Gold or Hyatt Explorist status = zero tangible value, no real perks of value. If AF is not &lt; tangible benefits then card is cancelled a year after signup bonus received.  Quote: No, what I said was CPC customers like me (who don't have millions under management) will flee if they are relegated to an inferior product like CSR. It has nothing to do with the \"shiny card\" (as I noted) and everything to do with UC and PP membership (which unlike Amex includes restaurants and 2 guests). If you want to see what happens when a card is gutted just check out the City National Bank Crystal Card discussion. Everyone is severing their relationship with CNB, not just cancelling the card.

Xyzzy, mia and gooselee like this.", "Thanks! I did get a reply from the insurance claims handler today asking for more documentation - specifically confirmation from the provider of the reason of cancellation and that they did not provide a refund. I explained that the provider was no longer responding, which was the entire reason I was going the insurance route. I did mention that I believed the cancellation was due to the blizzard, though the cancellation email itself did not identify any reason. I suppose this should be easy enough to support with a historical weather report. Rep was very friendly and seemed to understand the dilemma. She made some manual notes and forwarded back to the examiner. So another 5-7 business day wait to hear back. Will try to keep this thread updated. If the claim is denied then I'll try the chargeback. I'm kind of kicking myself for not just going to their office while I was there to take care of it all; but I didn't realize they'd have such an issue processing a refund.", "I am relying on CSR as my trip cancellation insurance for a forthcoming trip to Hawaii. The flights and hotels are booked and paid for with CSR. If I want to be covered for nonrefundable excursions, do I also need to use CSR for those?

JBauer likes this.", "Hi all, a strike question:  I'm in France right now and December 5 keeps off one of their biggest transportation union strikes in possibly decades, with train, Paris metro, and I think Air France workers striking with no end in sight. I know most trip delay insurance insurances only cover \"unannounced\" strikes and not planned ones (sometimes in France they announce 1 or 2 day strikes with an end) but there's no announcement on when this will end. They're not selling train tickets for Dec 5 or 6 but they are still selling for Dec 7, when I'll be going from Lyon to Paris. Do you guys think, if they do continue to strike that day (a Saturday), Chase would refuse to cover expenses?", "liilak The Chase terms do not differentiate types of strikes only \"...an organized strike that affects public transportation\".

Are you staying in a hotel in either city? Are you assuming you will be trapped in Lyon and want the extra hotel nights there covered? Are you worried about your non-refundable room in Paris you won't be able to stay in? Are you worried about getting your train ticket refunded? Are you hoping it will cover a car rental, bus ticket, or plane ticket from Lyon to Paris? Are you hoping for coverage of meals you eat in your extra day(s) in Lyon? Are you hoping to have covered a change fee for your return Paris-&gt;USA flight that you will miss if the strike happens?", "I read through the wiki and have a report to add before I ask my question - for the following:\"I was delayed on my outbound and claimed $500. Now am I delayed on my inbound. Am I covered? Unknown, no reports on this thread. Chase says \"per trip\" on the phone, but Guide says \"per ticket\". So a round-trip ticket may not cover two delays, but two one-ways could.\" In November 2014, I was on a single ticket booked SFO-IAH-BOG-CTG-[four day stopover]-EWR-SYR-[four day stopover]-IAD-SFO (this was in my 1K days before the PQD req, hence all the legs that I was happy to take!). IAH-BOG was diverted to PTY for a night due to volcanic activity near BOG. Took the airline voucher for the hotel as it was a decent one, but (1) bought a jacket/toiletries from a nearby mall (was pouring in PTY) and (2) had a nice room service dinner and breakfast the next day - total ~US$400. All was reimbursed by Chase. Then later on the same ticket, my EWR-SYR flight was hit with rolling delays before an ultimate cancellation, with no flights available to any nearby airports that night. The PH NYC had just opened and I found a points + cash rate available for that night, with the cash component being $300. I hopped in a cab or Uber into the city, had a nice room service meal, and went back for the first flight out the next day - total just under the US$500 limit. So in a single ticket, I had two different overnight delay situations, and almost maxed out the $500 benefit for both occurrences, with all submitted receipts reimbursed with my CSP protections. I have updated the wiki to link to this report. ---- Now separately for my new question  I'm sorry if this question is super noob, but I've tried searching and googling to no avail - maybe my search terms aren't leading me down the right path. My s/o and I are taking Norwegian (that was my first mistake, yada yada, I know) roundtrip LAX-CDG-LAX in January, paid for on my CSR. I just got an email that we have been moved from our original return flight to a flight at the same time the next day - it looks like our original flight is no longer operating. Besides needing to take an extra day off work, it'll also be another night at a hotel + meals. However, given I'm being told this now (~7 weeks out), I don't know what our options are. Norwegian has no partners I can rebook on, and return flights on other carriers are many multiples of what we paid, so we'd prefer to not go that route. I know we're not eligible for EU comp due to &gt;2 weeks out notice, and the CSR benefits guide says the benefit is only for delays not known before the trip starts, but..... does that mean I'm truly SOL? Is there nothing I can claim in this situation with all the various protections we have?", "8 months of back-and-forth over email finally culminated this week in a 2x $125 change fee reimbursement due to trip interruption (illness). Original flight was domestic R/T for 2x pax using AS companion fare. (AS generously allowed me to reschedule for 3 months later.)", "I'm still.waiting for my Nov.5 claim for trip delay to process. I sent them the cancellation.reason form.and an explanation for the second person on ticket via email. And they never responded.

I just saw when I checked it that it was still processing and two items were supposedly awaiting upload (relationship to other traveler and cancellation reason letter). Again this was stuff I emailed to them but apparently they didn't receive...", "This is pretty common.  They aren't very thorough about going through the stuff you send them and they aren't very proactive about asking for more.  Even if you already sent it, just send it again.   EkekoBWI likes this.", "So Funny enough, I got an email at 3pm or so saying that my claim was approved. Just to summarize my Trip Delay claim, I filed on Nov 5 2019 for a trip delay. My flight was cancelled on a Nov 1 return and I rescheduled a return flight on the same flight 24 hours later on Frontier. (On a side note, if I had booked it via Frontier's web link to schedule on another carrier or them for up to $400 in flight, I could have booked the same flight and got it reimbursed from Frontier, thus getting the 3X CSR miles from it. Instead I eventually went to the counter and got them to book me on that flight (supposedly the last seat too). I couldn't get the exact reason out of the agent so I wasn't going to try to go nuts with the room like some people have in this thread. I called Frontier to get the cancellation reason and they tried sending me the same form that I had been emailed and also given at the airport. It just said my flight was cancelled and gave me my options for rebooking. It wasn't until I message Customer Service via their website that I got an email stating that the reason for the delay was \"Unexpected Maintenance.\" I printed that email to PDF and that was the last thing I got to upload Dec 1(again I had emailed it to them two weeks ago as well). Either the Dec 1 upload just got seen or they took that long to get to the email version from two weeks ago. I claimed a car rental and gas (I was prepared with Uber screen shots showing a Surge price of $29 from LAS airport the Paris Hotel in case they tried to deny the rental). My rental and gas was only about $38 total so two Ubers would have definitely cost more. As I might have mentioned in an earlier post, I booked the Paris (and I saved them a resort fee due to my status with CET) for $63. I claimed Mon Ami Gabi in the Paris for lunch (about $60 with tip) and Dinner at the Oyster Bar restaurant in Harrah's (about $24 with tip). I also claimed some beverages, $50 in clothes, and an Uber home. About $260 total. They reimbursed the tips (most in the thread have reported the same, but I believe there a few data points where people had that deducted from their claim). This trip delay insurance is a great benefit. I actually hope I get a covered delay in the future. If I hadn't had an eating contest the day I returned, I would have eaten more (though it might have cost them less as I might have just gone to the Wicked Spoon Buffet at Cosmo, or I might have added another meal). I could see burning close to the $500, though, if I had a cancellation on my Friday morning redeye (which I often do to avoid the expensive weekend nights in Vegas). As stated in the quote above, keep checking the status of your claim as they don't really respond or keep you informed. (I will say the one other time I used this benefit, and we just claimed a $45 dinner, I filed the claim by mail and they were more responsive then with a mailed response asking for addition paperwork).", "CSR Delay Insurance for a Missed Connection    I'm flying DCA -&gt; PHL -&gt; SFO on AA in January with an extremely-tight layover\u0097just 33 minutes\u0097in PHL, on an award ticket but with fees paid on my CSR. I'm worried about missing my connection even if the flight is never formally delayed due to weather/mechanical issues, etc., but we just have to wait a few minutes for a gate in PHL or my gates end up being located far apart. If I missed the connection, I'd almost certainly need to do an overnight in PHL or elsewhere since I'm on AA's last flight of the day to SFO. Would these be reimbursable expenses in a scenario like the one I outlined above (or even if the flights were on time but I couldn't make the connection)?

In reality they seem to cover all carrier-caused delays (e.g. for crew shortage, etc.).  I'm fairly confident that as long as your first flight arrives later than scheduled, even if just by a few minutes, you'll be covered (though of course I could be wrong). I don't know what happens if your flight arrives on time (door open) but between waiting for pax in front of you, waiting for valet-checked bags, and running through the terminal you miss it anyway.  If this happens please report back! I'd ask for some kind of delay letter in the airport (\"I need a delay letter / military excuse to submit to me travel insurance\") and then also request one on AA's website after the fact (see wiki).  See what it says for cause of delay and pick the one that seems more likely to go through with fewest raised eyebrows.", "Thanks for the insight.

Wife goes to Vons and tries to make the purchase (one hour later), but card not honored AGAIN this year.  The first year, okay as she did not call first.  The second year angry, as she called first.  This year really embarrassed as a lot of people were giving her the \"poor old lady\" overspent her card look.  Vons tried to process twice.  Meantime I got an alert on our pc (I was home) that the card had been declined and was it okay to allow it.  I replied YES to both.  I then called my wife's cell and left a message.  She was trying to call Chase but was put on infinite hold.  Bottom line, the clerk at Vons decided to split the purchase into two smaller purchases.   The first went thru ($500), the second did not.  Wife eventually used a different card for the balance of the purchase.  This complicated the Vons points we were to get with the gift cards purchase (a different issue, but Vons called \"headquarters\" and we got our points a hour later). When she got home, she was really upset.  I told her to call Chase and tell them what happen and ask for a waiver of the card fee for one year, after three years of hassle and embarrassment.  She called.  Gave the operator the ladies name at Chase that she talked to.  Chase is sorry but cannot provide anything more.   Transferred to customer retention.  Asked for waiver of card fee.  No deal.  Asked for UA points.  No deal.  So after being a card holder for more than 3 decades she cancelled!   I, hubby, have card too.

Even better -- a customer that is demonstrating engagement (by spending on the CC).", "Sure - airlines make a lot from credit card deals. But again - there is no direct causation. For example, UA earns its money directly from Chase, which Chase earns its money directly from you. If UA truly values credit card spending, UA would not eliminate PQD, as well as its waiver. Also - don't forget, when you earn miles from credit card, while the airline profits from the bank, a liability is also created for the outstanding miles. When this is not an official position, I would see airlines will say that the money the airline earned from you has been even out by the liability.

It is only affected by your credit report.  For instance I was at 3/24 at the end of October.  I applied for both the Amex Platinum and the Hilton card on the same day.  Amex doesn't report until your second billing cycle.  A few days later I decided to go ahead and apply for the IHG card.  According to my CR I was only at 3/24 because the Amex cards hadn't reported yet.  I was at 3/24 for almost a month before the IHG card hit my report, making me 4/24.  My Amex Platinum will post sometime tomorrow night or the next day putting me at 5/24.

It's the bureaus (EQ/EX/TU) who combine pulls if they can't tell them apart.  The pull only includes information about the issuer and the date, and so if two pulls come in looking the same with the same date, the bureau can't be sure whether they're duplicates or not, so they don't count these potential duplicates. The reason business and personal pulls don't combine at most banks is because the bureau can tell them apart, because the issuer puts info in there that's different for personal apps than for business apps, because they're handled by a different group of offices within the bank.  So a bank A personal pull might come into the bureau saying something like \"bank A consumer services\" while a bank A business pull might come into bureau saying something like \"bank A business services\".  The bureau can't tell two \"bank A consumer services\" pulls apart from each other that have the same date, but it certainly can tell there difference between \"personal\" and \"business\".  (The actual IDs of two groups within the bank may be very different -- they could be alphanumeric mumbo jumbo, for all I know -- but the illustration is just to make clear that they are different enough to not have any risk of being duplicates of each other.)   bgriffin likes this.", "We have plenty of data points (in the Applying thread) that show that for whatever unknown reason, Chase evaluates 5/24 by looking at your credit report and nothing else (specifically, nothing within Chase's databases). There were people who applied in cases where they'd be at 6/24 or above if Chase was counting their own business cards opened months ago, but 4/24 or below if Chase's didn't count those, and all of those people were approved. Multiple data points of that sort proved that Chase wasn't counting their own business cards. Now, of course, Chase could change how they do this count tomorrow. But so far we have not had any datapoints showing that they've changed their count. Ie, we're not guessing about what Chase does. We're gathering evidence about what Chase does.

Hi All, I have some big expenses coming up (probably could hit $10k or so in minimum spend for signup bonuses), so it's a good time to apply for a card(s) that might need a significant signup bonus. With Chase, specifically: I'm now at 4/24 after getting the two cards below... Early October 2019 - Applied and approved after about 10 days for Chase Southwest Performance Business card (with $5,000 credit limit) November 1st 2019 - Applied and instantly approved for Chase Southwest Plus card (only $2,000 credit limit) Other Chase cards I have:Chase Ink Cash ($6k limit - total of $11k limit on my two biz cards) Chase Sapphire Reserve ($33k limit) Chase Freedom ($22k limit) Chase IHG ($10k limit) So a total of $67k credit limit on personal cards, plus the $11k on biz cards, puts me at $78k total CL) And I have a Chase personal checking account And I just paid off a Chase auto loan a few months ago (which caused my credit score to drop a lot) Anyway... I'd like to use up my last one (or two?) Chase slots. Suggestions on what I should do? Chase Ink Business Preferred - 80k on $5k spend. I would like this card the most for the big signup bonus! But with the 2 Chase Biz CCs already (and considering just $40k in biz revenue), are my odds low? I'd like Chase IHG Premier, but the bonus was 125k + $50 credit and now is just 80k points.  I'd like Chase Marriott Bonvoy Boundless, but the bonus was 100k and now is just 75k points.  Also, I had the old SPG personal (and Biz) cards, so I'm not sure if I'm eligible? And I'd like to have the Chase Freedom Unlimited, but it seems a waste of one of my 5/24 slots (considering I get more from sign up bonuses than I would from actual spend)... Chase United would be good too, but I need hotel points more than airline points right now (and don't really like United)... Should I try applying for the Ink Biz Pref AND the IHG or Marriott on the same day? Or would that make it unlikely that I would get the Ink (and maybe get the IHG or Marriott)? And which should I try for first?  I could also get non-Chase card(s), like the Amex Marriott Biz (but again, am I eligible if I had SPG Biz)? And I'd prefer to use up my last Chase spot first. FYI, my credit scores are 807 Transunion, 802 Equifax, and 790 Experian. Experian dropped from 836 in July to 814 after my car got paid off and then to 790 after the two new Chase accounts.

At any rate, I saw it in my email and you made a good point that occasional pre-approvals may show up for Chase branded cards, but not co-branded cards.

It's just unfortunate those two have lower offers right now. Thx, --Kyle", "That's weird that it got deleted.

Hi All,  I just got approved (in branch) today for the Chase Ink Business Preferred. I was at 4/24, so now I'm at 5/24. Is there a window to apply for one more card today?  Or is that a bad idea (upsetting Chase perhaps)? Obviously (since I got down to 2/24 recently), I haven't gotten a lot of new cards lately. However, I got 2 other new Chase cards: Chase Southwest Performance Business around October 7th (to become 3/24) then Chase Southwest Plus on November 1st (to become 4/24). Should I try for the IHG, Marriott, or Freedom Unlimited? Or just be happy with what I got? I shouldn't have another inquiry since I'd be doing it on the same day.

I wouldn't get in a big hurry.", "Well all of those cards were with Chase though. And I think Chase's own biz cards count towards 5/24 limit... At any rate, the main thing I'm trying to do here is get another card without another credit inquiry AND to get another Chase card while (if) I can. I have a lot of big expenses coming up, so now's a good time to get it and meet my minimum spend requirements. Thanks,  --Kyle", "Chase business cards do not count towards 5/24.  But it sounds like what you really wanna hear is yes apply for another Chase card.  So by all means apply for another Chase card.", "Why are you worried about an inquiry (aka hard pull)? They only drop your score a bit and it'll bounce back up in a couple months. Applying for two cards in one day will not combine the inquiries.  Chase can deny you a new card even if you are under 5/24. One reason I've seen used is \"too many recent cards\".  So feel free to apply but don't be surprised if you are turned down.  You really need to spend some time reading the wikipost in the \"Applying for Chase credit cards...\" before you attempt applying for another card.   bgriffin likes this.", "Hey,  It's always better to combine pulls in day if you can and keep that score up, IMO. Most card issues DO combine pulls for two apps in a single day. Chase included. That said, I forgot that business + personal apps might not be combined. However, if you read here you'll see reports that business and personal have been combined.  Yes, I realize I may be declined for reasons other than  5/24. I've read a lot about applying for Chase cards and have played the game quite awhile now.  I stand corrected on the Chase Business Cards counting towards 5/24. That used to be the case as you can see here, but apparently that changed at some point (text said they do count, is crossed out, and new text says that now they don't count). :-) So I won't rush to my next card as I should only be at 3/24 if that is correct. But the reason I started this post was because I wanted to get another Chase card in now while I have upcoming expenses to use it on and assuming my 5/24 slots were gone. Otherwise I'd apply for a card(s) with a different issuer and lose my ability to apply for Chase cards. Make sense? Now I'll probably wait a bit so that I can apply when Chase has a better bonus on the IHG or Marriott cards. Thanks,  --Kyle", "No, I wanted advice. Not sure why you're being snippy about it? I chose not to apply now because I learned that Chase biz cards don't count towards 5/24 - read the article I linked to above that had stated they did. That's how I had that knowledge. At any rate, the question I was trying to ask was is if you're at 4/24, if you can get two cards on one day (even though you'd be over 5/24). I searched more on DoctorOfCredit and found out that some have been able to do this. But no, I won't apply for another card now because I can wait until IHG or Marriott has a better bonus. Cheers,  --Kyle", "Wasn't trying to be snippy at all.  When someone puts up roadblocks to perfectly reasonable (and factual) replies it's generally because they are not getting the answer they want. I totally get wanting to pick up an extra Chase card now.  I have about 36 hours to decide if I'm going to apply for the Hyatt card or not before I'll go from 4/24 to 6/24 (because I did with Amex what you want to do with Chase).   Which card is best for you depends entirely on what you want to get out of it. Personally I am chasing (no pun intended) cards that have long term benefit to me as opposed to focusing on SUBs.", "Gotcha, thanks man. Maybe I'm a bit on edge with personal issues that have nothing to do with this.  Anywho, I don't do a ton of organic spending, so SUBs are key for me.  I'm slowing down with Amex myself after a huge run with them! I hadn't gotten any new Chase cards for years because of 5/24, but I had finally slowed down enough to be able to get a few. I probably need the Marriott most just because I don't have a way to keep my points alive with them unless I get one of their cards. Just hoping they up the SUB again!
