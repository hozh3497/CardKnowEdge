Since I've never tried to do that \"commute\" between the terminal, I am not sure if your 2 hours connection is enough but it seems a bit tight.

Centurion has an good but not wide selection of alcohol, felt like less variety than their other lounges. As of yesterday, all alcohol at Escape is free for Plat cardholders, including some surprisingly high-end brands. Port Charlotte scotch is served in the Centurion ($80/bottle it looks like). Standard coffee/espresso machines in both lounges, but Escape has a traditional espresso machine behind the bar for handmade drinks as well as 6 types of tea out (didn't see a tea section at Centurion, but I didn't look too hard for it). Decor at Escape was slightly better than Centurion IMO, Centurion felt a bit sterile to me, especially the bar and food section. Runway views available at both lounges. Overall, both good additions to the Amex network. If I was going back, I'd lean towards the Escape lounge unless I was really hungry.

The Escape should join Priority Pass and make it exclusive to Priority Pass and keep the AMEX Lounge for AMEX Cardholders.

I haven't been to either yet, but I look forward to seeing comparisons and hopefully making them for myself one day.

There is a dining room between the two that can be for either, but is partitioned off so only one lounge can access it at a time.

The Escape one is presented slightly better, but the Centurion is definitely the preferred choice for someone who is hungry. I did notice a basic charcuterie tray at the Escape lounge that the Amex lounge lacked. Alcohol: Escape has a basic level for most people (standard lounge fare - Jack/Bacardi/Walker Red/etc.) and then more premium labels that as of Wednesday are free for Amex cardholders (Basil Haydens, Makers, Ketel One, Hendricks, etc.). There is a bottle of Walker Blue Label there that is free for now, but I do not expect that to ever be re-ordered.

We were able to work through the process with GIO Canada, the independent 3rd party dispute resolution process in Canada for complaints against insurers. After much back and forth with them, they agreed to move our claim to mediation with the insurer. Within days of agreeing to move to mediation, GIO contacted us to notify us that the insurer had agreed to pay us for the entire cost of the claim against them to fully settle it. That was a few weeks ago, but we're still waiting to hear about a final resolution. Fingers crossed that it comes through and everything is sorted out as we're almost 10 months into this. For anyone else dealing with GIO in the future for this, or any other dispute, I recommend being firm and continually following-up to get your claim to move forward.

I would have expected Amex Plat and Centurion to be a bit clearer about the exclusions, no matter where you live. I understand the argument that many people have here about reading the insurance certificate, but I consider myself to be fairly savvy and to have read the insurance certificate in the past. But it's next to impossible to remember the specifically excluded vehicles, or what's considered exotic, without carrying the amex certificate of insurance with you everywhere haha.

They had Confirmation numbers, assigned seats, everything but a boarding pass. Get to the airport and are told their itinerary was never completely ticketed and they need to contact AmEx travel. Spend 30 minutes on hold with AmEx travel before they finally get someone on the phone, but by then it\u0092s too late and they\u0092re missing their flight. Spend the next three hours on the phone with AmEx travel to no avail trying to get a decent routing that doesn\u0092t eat up multiple days of their trip before finally deciding to book an $800 cash fare on B6/SA TPA-JFK-JNB tomorrow morning. Lucky for them the fare mysteriously plummeted in price from $3000 to $800 around 9:30PM. Now they\u0092re trying to work with AmEx travel to get the return flight \u0093reinstated\u0094. Does anyone have insight into likely outcomes here? I haven\u0092t spoken with them on the phone to determine whether or not AmEx is taking responsibility for the issue. Based on my understanding of ticketing, I\u0092m struggling to come up with a scenario where AmEx honors the flight home if they aren\u0092t utilizing an AmEx ticket on the outbound. Seems like they\u0092re going to get a refund at best and be stuck buying a close-in one-way home. Anyone have insight they can provide on how this might be handled?", "Was the primary cardholder also one of the passengers ticketed for the flight itinerary? Whom are they speaking with on the phone for 3 hours that can't get a manager or floor supervisor on the phone to find an answer? Generally anytime I book an itinerary through amex travel, be it hotel or flight (using MR), they will immediately debit the cash value from the card, then proceed to process the points equivalent and give statement credits within 24-48 hours. So that is typically a paper trail I look for, and confirmation numbers are furnished in email virtually immediately. If the cardholder has email proof of the confirmation number (print out/digital), or a valid confirmation number inside AMEX's system, It would be pretty difficult for them not to accept responsibility, unless I am missing something. Entire thing sounds like a massive nightmare, wish them luck.", "It sounds to me like they had a reservation but the ticket was never issued. The key question is whether there ever was a ticket receipt showing a ticket number, not just some confirmation number. If they had tried to do OLCI (ideally well before going to the airport) but weren't able to get boarding passes, this should be a red flag that someone needed to call AmEx travel and/or the airline ASAP. BTW, what part of AmEx Travel was used? I've never had such a long wait to reach PTS by phone and the agents usually seem very competent.", "First question is whether your friends each had an e-ticket number.  Not a confirmation or itinerary, but an e-ticket.  If they have an Amex confirmation # and not an e-ticket, then it really is on Amex to get them home.  Whether Amex does that by using its back channels to get the original reservation reinstated and at the price it would have paid or by some other means is not your friends' concern. Getting all of this done is going to take a lot of time, patience and Skype.   Any chance that $800 fare is available on the way back?  If so, might seem to be a great deal and might be an outstanding result. For the benefit of others, always check that you have e-tickets with a 17-digit e-ticket number covering all segments of the itinerary.  It takes about 30 seconds to review what typically arrives via email or which can be pulled up online from the ticketing carrier.  Never rely on any other document as it is the e-ticket which the carrier uses to get paid.", "My experience with them is you have to watch like a hawk to make sure it gets ticketed.

Another data point, I have probably visited about 40+ Delta SkyClubs this year and I have only heard those same comments TWICE.

The fine print says the MQM won't be added for 4-8 weeks! What the hay! How is that going to help him?? Why did she tell us that would take care of it?? Does it truly aways take that long even if we do the spend right away AND pay it off right away?? I'm thinking with hong kong trips, the eventual 5KMQM, the rollovers and him spending on the card he can up the status quickly, but mid year??", "Where do you see this? In any event, the issue is whether the MQM's count for the year in which they are earned, or the year in which they are posted. Quote:", "You may still have a chance of it posting before the end of the year.  In my experience, the bonus tends to post within a few days of the spending goal being reached.  The only time I've run into the \"4-8 weeks\" language is when I know there's something wrong with the transaction but they make me wait 8 weeks anyway.  Perhaps others can provide some data points.", "Mia, sorry, not 8 but 12, you are correct. So my plan is to see the approval, pay off all of our insurance accounts and then pay off the card all within 2 days. I'll call AMX and ask them about getting those MQMs posted before year's end. Thank you!", "As I've understood it from other threads, as long as the spend posts to Amex by December 31 (so potentially up to a week after the purchase), the MQMs are backdated to 2019 and 2020 status and rollover are recalculated.  Also relevant is that the status in force for benefit purposes in 2019 carries through January 2020 (largely to allow for delayed adjustments like ORC etc.). In that case (and if I've been understanding these threads properly), this could happen * finish 2019 with 45,200 MQM * start 2020 with Silver status and 20,200 MQM, but still enjoying Platinum benefits (I think I got from your post that he had Platinum for 2019) * if Amex posts the 5k MQM by January 31, that turns into Gold status and 200 MQM plus earnings from 2020 flights * if the posting is further delayed into February, then it's Silver status and 20,200 MQM plus earnings from 2020 flights until the Gold status in the previous bullet point kicks in One interesting question would be if it's possible in the last scenario to get bonus RDM that you would have earned on flights in that February interim period of Silver credited or have any fees that would have been waived for a Gold in that period refunded.", "Yes in deed! That is an interesting question I will post an update as this scenario plays out. He was only able to thaw two out of three of his credit freezes so they did not give an instantaneous approval. I finally got all three done so hopefully the approval will come through quickly", "NO. The question isn't when AmEx posts the MQMs to the DL FF account but whether the 5,000 MQMs will count for 2019 or 2020. The threshold spend MQMs (10,000 MQMs for a $25,000 spend on the DL Plat card and 15,000 MQMs for $30,000 spend on the Reserve card) count spend by the calendar year and even if the miles for 2019 spend are credited in 2020, they will count as 2019 miles for status and rollover purposes. Whether the miles post by January 31st or not is irrelevant. If they're 2019 miles, he gets GM through January 31, 2021 assuming that the MQD requirement is met. If they're 2020 miles, he'll be FO until a higher status is earned. With DL one earns status on a CALENDAR year basis but the previous year's status is retained through January 31st to allow late posting stuff to be credited to the account before people lose status.", "As I just stated in my post above (where I forgot to quote this post), some of the information in this post is wrong.", "I'm not sure there's any discrepancy between what we've posted.  If the 2019 MQMs don't hit Delta until after January 31, for flights in the period between February 1 and when the 2019 MQMs hit DL one would be flying with the Silver status had absent those 2019 MQMs.", "OH gosh yall...I'm sooo confused. So If he has 45K MQM (and the dollar spend was already done) on December 31, 2019 but he is currently Platinum from the previous years miles, then he goes into 2020 as silver after plat ends Feb 1.  THEN...say, sometimes in late January those 5K MQMs post, they'll go into the 2020 box of miles that will determine the following years status AND the current year IF he flies enough to gain MQMs and that spend happens.   Right? OR... He gets credited with the 5K MQMs in late Dec 2019, ends December 31, 2019 with 50K MQMs, he goes into 2020 as a gold after his platinum status ends Fed 1. But if he flies and flies and spends and spends can he progress up to Platinum mid year? I think my head hurts.", "MSPeconomist is definitely correct insofar as the threshold bonus on each 25k (or 30k for the Reserve card). The 5k sign-up bonus *probably* follows the same December 31 \"spend\" deadline (and not when the miles actually post). As a side note, it always comes up that someone spends on December 31, and the merchant posts the sale to Amex on Jan 1. In that case, the MQM's will towards a threshold bonus in 2020, not 2019. As past years go, our Skymiles MQM balances in January will be nonsensical until Delta's computers catch up. Negative balances when Delta deletes the MQM's for 2020 status. MQM's post to a flyer's account at the close of his or her billing cycle. Quite possible for someone to not get their earned status on Delta.com until end of January or even early February. But the general point is correct that the status update *should* backdate to January 1. No idea if Delta will handle the timing of the 5k MQM bonus per the OP's question automatically, or whether OP will need to ask Delta to make a correction in February -- assuming the MQM's wrongly credit for 2020. Same for missed RDM bonuses for January flights taken before the new status is recognized. In any case, I'd give Delta until February to sort this out.", "Yes, you do pose a lot of things to think about. My plan is to spend the $3K immediately and pay it off as soon as the charge posts. We'll just go from there. I will update every on what happens.", "Same issue    Same issue here. I hit the spend threshold last week and paid it immediately and I need the MQMs to count for 19 to keep my status in 20.  I looked at my delta account and my miles from AmEx seem to hit on the 10th of the following month. So I hit threshold in early December, pay in early December but likely that miles likely not credited until 1/10/20. Going to be really pissed if they don\u0092t count toward 19 as I was prepaying bill, buying gift cards etc to hit the threshold by year end. Ugh!", "Is this the welcome bonus for a *new* DL AmEx card or not? If you're talking about the annual threshold MQM bonuses (10,000 MQMs for $25,000 and $50,000 on DL Plat card and 15,000 MQMs for $30,000 and $60,000 spend on the reserve card, to be changed somewhat in 2020), please don't worry as spend that POSTS TO YOUR CREDIT CARD during the calendar year (regardless of your billing cycle and regardless of when you pay providing that your AmEx accounts remain in good standing) will lead to MQMs that count for that calendar year, 2019 in your case. For such MQMs, DL backdates them to the calendar year in which the spend threshold was reached regardless of when they actually hit your FF account. The question here concerns the initial welcome bonus offers that the Plat and Reserve card generally carry for new and upgraded accounts, typically something like 5,000 MQMs for perhaps $3000-$10,000 spend during the first several months. For *these* MQMs, there's a question of whether spend depends on the calendar year or one's own billing cycle for the purpose of determining whether the WELCOME BONUS MQMS (and only these welcome bonus one time MQMs) will count as having been earning in 2019 or 2020.", "This is strictly concerning the bonus MQMs and whether they will be credited towards the 2020 status if bonus requirements are met in Dec.

If you scheduled a payment in advance on the Amex website, you should be able to cancel it without repercussion if you do so before the deadline.  After the deadline, there's no way to cancel it.  The same would be true of a bank's bill pay service.   What I suspect is meant by \"cancel\" is something that caused the payment to be returned by the bank unpaid.  It could be a bank bill pay check that was sent out and then the customer put in a \"stop payment\" request.  Or, it could be an ACH transaction that they disputed and had sent back unpaid (generated either by bank BillPay, or from the Amex website).  In any of those situations, it would be a matter of a payment actually being submitted to the customer's bank and then being returned unpaid.  Even before the recent anti-money-laundering crackdowns that others have mentioned, creditors have for a long time been very uncomfortable with any situation that results in a payment being returned unpaid, much more so than late payments, and even in the case where the money wasn't even owed.  For whatever reason, it just makes them nervous.

She said that it was \"no problem\" if the payment didn't go through (two separate reps actually told me this) so I moved some of the cash out of that checking account so the payment wouldn't go through. It didn't, but then they immediately cancelled my account. If I thought they were going to do this, I would have just made the payment.

The SDL for the high balance team would have far more scrutiny on their portfolio for customer satisfaction given the HB team is often dealing with celebrities, CEOs and executives, successful business owners, etc. Not everyone who has an account with this team is a Centurion (a lot of high balance cardholders don't see any benefit in the Centurion program or its fees). So....all of that being said...the OP needs to call back, get a supervisor and find out if his former account(s) were managed by the high balance team, and if so, try and get with a supervisor to review the matter with the group's SDL. If it's not the high balance team, it will be the general 'credit' team, and every group within Amex be it credit, high balance, high risk, government, etc etc will all have a SDL, and above them, a director who owns that division - the point being, there are a lot of escalation options to try and get everything put back to where it was before.

Fresh experience from being a peddler of the Rewards+ card is why I knew what to make about the merits of a  claim about CLI requests on very young Citicard accounts. Otherwise, absent correction from an experienced party inside or outside of Citi, I would have probably been under the impression that such young accounts had very little chance for a CLI to happen upon customer request for a CLI (at least for those whose  income and housing costs remained constant during the period between card application time and CLI request times)..", "I would have thought the same since Citi has historically been a fairly conservative lender, (but perhaps that's limited only to the sub-prime customer market).", "Whether a CL increase will be approved depends on many factors.  If OP's card is one of those \"starter\" cards with a $500 CL, an increase of $1,000 is 300% of the CL.  If the current CL is $20L, then $1K is only 5%. An issuer may also grant a temporary increase for a specific purchase.  While that may not be useful in many settings, it can be quite useful for someone who has other major credit-impacting activities on the horizon, such as a real estate closing. If OP has any concerns about whether a CL will be approved, it is worth the time to call in and explore options.  It certainly doesn't help to get a $1K increase if you need $10K, so the call becomes worth the effort.", "50% increase of the CL within 90 days of account opening being done without a hard hit on the CR hasn\u2019t been unusual for some of the no-annual-fee Citicards issued in recent months.

If that is the case, it would make all the sense in the world for Citi to crack down on its underwriting. As noted above, it would do little good, in any event, to have Citi issue the card with the bonus, only to have AA credit the bonus and then close and zero out the account.

Citi's current time limitation is 48 months from when you last received a sign-up bonus for the exact card product.  (Previously it was 24 months based on the card \"family\").  So having held a \"similar\" card isn't the same, nor applicable to the current T&amp;Cs. - The above assumes that the offer under which you applied had the 48-month language, which all public links AFAIK have.  If you had a targeted offer without the restriction, then it obviously wouldn't apply.  Did you use a targeted offer (mailer for example) or a general public link?  Do you still have the link or offer to read its terms? - What prompted the telephone conversation?

If you expect to RELY on them to do anything important you're likely to be frustrated, it seems to me, based on all the reports we've seen on them. But it is definitely NOT the case that when they do come through it's just what you could have done on your own. I've used them multiple times to get recommendations for restaurants, restaurant reservations, and tickets when there was no availability online. We had an amazing vacation in Spain largely due to two great restaurant recommendations they gave us, which fit our specific request very well. These were definitely above and beyond the things we could have found online easily .. really special places both times. Compared with the Visa Infinite concierge (Sapphire Reserve) it was night and day --- the CSR concierge recommendations were really terrible haha. But I certainly wouldn't give them any task that I felt had to happen right, at a certain time, etc. That's just setting yourself up for disappointment.

They came back with two utterly bizarre recommendations for breakfast -- \"Tea for Two\", a British high tea spot, and \"Cafe Flandes\" which is supposedly a Dutch-style coffee shop. \"Tea for Two\" wasn't even open on the days we were there, due to vacation schedules. We decided to try \"Cafe Flandes\" to see what it was about -- which wasn't much. It was literally diner food, not horrible but nothing other than completely mediocre. Also: how odd is it to recommend a British place and what amounts to basically just some random diner when we are traveling in Spain? Were they terrified of recommending anything local or authentic or even basically high quality? Asked Amex Platinum Concierge to give us recommendations for moderately priced restaurants in Valencia and Barcelona, our next two destinations. In Valencia they recommended a couple spots near the train station we were going to use. The first was Sagardi Valencia Centro, a perfect spot a short walk from the train, which they described as \"for years the great reference of Basque cuisine in Valencia\". It was simultaneously quite affordable and superb -- everything from the ambience to the service to the food itself -- stupendous, and something we wouldn't have easily found by Yelp searches. It was also across from some amazing medieval architecture which we also loved looking at as we dined. Barcelona was a bit more of a mixed success. Their primary restaurant recommendation was awesome -- Cera 23. There were some issues though -- the whole thing is happening during the holidays and when I tried to make reservations after receiving their recommendations, nothing was available until very late in the evening (10:30pm). I asked them to try to reschedule and/or get a reservation at another restaurant but they didn't even look at my email for over a day. By then there were no options left. It appears that email responses and emailed requests get low priority, even when responding to an email they sent. In future whenever I need to do anything with the concierge, I will call, not email, if I can. The other thing is Cera 23 is in a rough neighborhood of Barcelona. It was fine for us -- we like to go to places more on the \"edgy\" side and this place perfectly fit our preferences. I wonder if this is something they somehow figured out from my profile or if they knew it. I didn't mention anything like that when I contacted them, On the other hand, if they give this recommendation to a lot of people I imagine some might find the place a little intimidating. We had a fabulous time, however, at Cera 23 and were suitably impressed with both the quality of their recommendations and how well they happened to suit our mood and taste, based on very little hinting from me. The contrast, however, with the awful Visa Infinite concierge was immense. It may be that Amex isn't always able to pull off restaurant reservation miracles --- but even just putting together a cool itinerary was itself pretty amazing. I will definitely consider using them again when I visit an unknown city especially abroad.   Statman, lax01 and happychic like this.", "Called 6 months in advance for restaurant reservation in BCN.  Concierge understood that restaurant needed to be booked a midnight Spain time on a specific day.  Got an email three days after the required booking day saying they were unable to book.  Funny thing is, I anticipated their failure and got online at about 1 AM Spain time and booked a backup reservation at the same restaurant.  That tells me that 1) Amex missed the midnight deadline and 2) they missed it by a pretty wide margin. I think I'm going to cancel my Biz Plat card at this point.  It's been a good run, but they're not saving me any time anymore and the annual fee has become exorbitant at $595.", "From this and other reports I don\u0092t think you can really use the Platinum concierge for anything you actually need reliably to happen at this point. It\u0092s more of a value add service where anything you ask them to do has to be something that would be a value add if it happens but OK if it doesn\u0092t work. On the same Spain trip I had a good experience with above, they also forgot to respond to an emailed request in a timely manner and only \u0093noticed\u0094 it when I sent another request to remind them. Etc. So they\u0092re really not a reliable \u0093personal assistant\u0094; maybe they used to be in the past but certainly not these days.

Particularly ones with  complicated timings or language barriers.   Now, unreliability seems to be the trend.  They botched a trip to Mexico City two years ago for us, too, missing the booking window for Pujol by not minutes or hours, but days.  Oh, well.  As with all good things, devaluation as inertia is always a at work.", "Yeah I\u0092ve been reading management at Circles has declined in quality since they moved their offices to Canada. There\u0092s too much attrition and a focus on customer surveys; they fire employees for bad survey results without checking to see why they got the reviews: but if an agent fails to get a request done it may have nothing to do with the agent, it may have been systems or processes beyond their control - this is a lesson anyone in quality control needs to learn - you need to investigate why a failure occurred not simply that it occurred, and firing the employee may do zero to improve quality when the problem is elsewhere in your system. However since I don\u0092t rely on them for anything critical I\u0092m still getting value out of it. It\u0092s easier to maximize the credits on the personal card anyway so for $50/year why not? I also have a business card but it\u0092s paid for by my company so I might as well keep that one.", "Poor experience with Am Ex Concierge    I'm not quite sure where to ask about this so thought I'd start here. A few months ago I bought tickets to a show through Telecharge using my AmEx platinum card. Because of a disability, I need an aisle seat, so that is what I bought. I bought the tickets a year in advance as the show is likely to be very popular (it won't start until next fall.) Three months after I bought the tickets, I was browsing the Telecharge site and noticed that my tickets weren't on the aisle. The seating chart had been inexplicably changed. I called Telecharge and they were able to move me over two seats to the aisle, but I had to also choose a different day, which was fine. I also ended up having to pay more because the pricing had gone up - which didn't seem right but whatever. Then about two weeks after that, an announcement was issued that that the venue had been changed and now my *second* sets of seat were no longer on the aisle. It was impossible to get through to Telecharge this time, so since I had bought these with AmEx Platinum, I decided to call the concierge line to see if they could help this time. They said that they would reach out to Telecharge for me as they have an internal group that deals with them. The result was that they got me back on the aisle, but in the back of the section *and* I had to again pay more since the price of the seats had gone up again. They told me that I was best off securing these seats so I had *something* on the aisle but that they would try to get me closer to where I was going to sit initially. It has now been six weeks since that first call. I keep getting emails from AmEx (from different people - there was one person working on it for about three weeks and she seems to have disappeared, so now it's different people each time) that they are \"working on it\" and meanwhile, I'm sure all those new aisle seats that popped up when the venue changed are being sold if not sold already. I did try to call Telecharge again myself, but they told me that since AmEx had contacted them, they were working directly with AmEx and that there was nothing they could do for me - that I should continue to work through AmEx. These two tickets were close to $500 once I paid twice more each time my seats were changed. Going in and buying a whole new set isn't really an option - and I think they have also hiked up the price significantly since I initially bought (which is probably why they don't want to give me seats like I initially had). I know I will see the show and I do have an aisle seat in the back, but it doesn't seem right or fair. I know the theatre change is not AmEx's fault but I am so disappointed that, using their concierge service, I was asked to pay more money for worse seats and that they have not been able to help me with something that doesn't seem like a crazy request - but I'm happy to hear opinions/suggestions about this. (I don't have a Twitter so I won't be Tweeting anyone to complain - in fact, I'm not great at the public complaining thing in general...) Thank you for any thoughts. P.S.  I think this probably belongs in the AmEx forum but I don't know how to move and don't want to repeat post.  Hopefully a moderator can move it.  Thanks in advance.", "I'm sorry to hear about your experience, but I doubt there is much that Amex can or will do.

A credit card that doesn\u2019t do anything for me, especially if relatively new (got the A+ a year ago), isn\u2019t worth keeping even if it doesn\u2019t cost an annual fee. The loss of a $12k credit line doesn\u2019t bother me. The one feature I am considering as a plus of the A+/A cards is the PIN capability for international travel. I mostly have no issues with my preferred card (CSR), but did use the A+ a couple of times for unattended ticket vending machines last year. I was curious to see if it would accept my PIN (it did); I did not compare with the CSR at the time. I still have the Aviator Red card (with the same PIN behavior, I believe). Also on the chopping block, though, once the final 10k AA RDMs post. My ultimate fallback PIN card is a European bank issued MasterCard. Earns me nothing, but good to have for that occasional unattended gas pump. In short, if they offer me the downgrade, I might take it. Have some more European trips coming up, so I can experiment some more with other cards. But it would likely be canceled soon as part of my \u201csimplification\u201d project.

WN may introduce fees of some type. anyone here going to buy thousands of $ for WN flights in 2020?", "I'm guessing WN is fine with the quick cancellation of flights and having the refund as a Travel Fund. They get paid the full amount, minus credit card fees. Sure, there's a very minor burden on their reservation systems, but worth the extra revenue. It's Amex that might decide to clamp down. Amex is better off if the airline statement credit goes unused. They might demand that WN code all ticket purchases -- even those under $100 -- as such, so that Amex doesn't credit any of them. It's hard to know on the outside how burdensome this would be on WN, and whether there's enough money involved to justify the effort. As many have observed on FlyerTalk, we are far from the norm among the traveling public. Only a tiny portion would ever go to the trouble of learning this end-around and exploiting it. Amex might figure that it's not worth it to play another cat-and-mouse game with the likes of us. Pretty good chance we'll just find another loophole. Besides, a lot of us are actually very profitable cardholders for Amex.   krazykanuck and IndyHoosier like this.", "nobody should think amex will just sit back and ignore this obvious loophole. they patched the GC method for a reason. they didnt like it and this loophole is even easier to stop. we are buying actual flights with L3 data. it wouldnt be that hard to ID and cut or clawback. and while i agree this community is a minority vs the entire cardmember base, we cost companies money. hence the war on churners the past few years to close loopholes and shut accounts down. its a very deliberate effort by amex/chase etc. im not so sure i want to begin 2020 with thousands of dollars worth of cancelled WN flights. im hesitant. not to mention i have 12 months to use the TF. i really need to figure some other long term option.", "On balance, Amex makes money on my business. Yes, I've exploited several bonus point offers, and I've always maxed out the airline statement credit. Still, the merchant fees it gets from my business are greater than the cost of the benefits Amex gives me. I'm not one of the most profitable customers for Amex, but they make money on me.

This is on the way out: Usually when I check in it gives me the option to split the itinerary in order for me to get put on the upgrade list, this option was not given to me when I checked in. The flight was on Christmas and had 12 empty first class seats (also an overnighter), I did not show up on the upgrade list. I asked the gate agent if I could get put on, I was denied, because the itinerary was not split, GA could not split it. Called customer service, she split the itinerary, but alas, I was never put on the upgrade list, but at least I had a whole row to myself! But, considering I am Plat and have a CC, I should be eligible for a CPU on an award ticket... Contacted customer service, they said there is a system issue, they compensated me On the way back: Customer service suggested I speak to someone to get put on the list, so I went to customer service in SFO, and I was on the list for my flight. Another situation where there were 6 open FC seats, I was #1  on the list.

What they actually mean is proof of financial responsibility. There is actually no law mandating how you need to pay for the damages if you are found to be responsible.

The car rental agency includes \"standard hire &amp; drive insurance\" as part of the base rate, which basically appears to be a plan where I'm on the hook for the excess in the event of a collision. The excess can be further reduced if I buy additional coverage. The agency seems to refer to the basic plan as the \"standard hire &amp; drive insurance\" and CDW interchangeably per the snip I attached. In this case, would CSR not cover the excess even it's included as part of the base rate? From what I'm reading here, it appears that offering the plan as part of the base rate isn't enough and that it has to be mandated by the government for the coverage to kick in as a secondary.

I took pictures of front and back of original rental agreement and also accident report, and of course the damage.  Highly recommend doing this.  I also filed a police report (see below) July 21: end of trip, returned new car.  Charge for the car rental sat as pending for a loooooooong time, then eventually posted as a higher amount.  Checked my bill and I was charged for FRANCHISE REDUITE for EUR 115 and I was also charged for returning my (broken) car without a full tank.  Took picture of front and back of new rental agreement. Jul 23: Started the claim process with eclaimsline to make sure I was within deadline, but didn't upload any documents.  Got an email saying I had to supply all the needed documents with 365 days.  They wanted a Demand Letter, Final Rental Agreement, and cc bill showing the charges. Aug 14: Filed Hertz inquiry asking if there would be any additional charges and asking what EUR 115 for FRANCHISE REDUITE was on my bill. Aug 27: Hertz wrote back saying the EUR 115 was for damage and that Hertz France would be getting back to me soon with more info and to direct further inquires to [email\u00a0protected] .  I didn't want to finalize my claim because I was worried there would be additional charges coming at me. Oct 22: Hertz France wrote back saying EUR 115 was from their damage matrix and included scans of the accident report, the rental agreement, and their damage matrix.  They didn't explicitly say there would be no more charges but I felt more confident that they had evaluated the damage and chosen to charge me this much. Oct 22: I replied to last eclaimsline email and attached accident report, new and old rental agreements, picture of damage, police report, bill from Hertz, email from Hertz saying that FRANCHISE REDUITE was for damages, and all the scans they had sent me, along with credit card statement showing the charge and last 4 digits. Oct 24: Notified by eclaimsline that my claim for EUR 115 had been approved.  I couldn't get the direct deposit option to work so they will send me a check. Extremely satisfied with Chase here, with only 2-day turnaround on the claim once they had the documents.  Extremely frustrated that the Hertz bill didn't just say what the charge was for and that they took almost 2 months to get back to a simple inquiry. Note on police report: This rental was in France and the car window was smashed overnight and personal belongings stolen.  I called the police and was told to go to the station to make a report.  I went to the police station and they had me fill out the multi-lingual report form, made we wait 2 hours, then told me (in fairly good English) that if I didn't speak French they would have to set me up with an appointment with a translator, for later that day, at a different station.  Since I had spoken 0 words of French to them the whole time I don't know why they waited 2 hours to tell me this. I took the intervening time to return my car to Hertz and get a new one, since there seemed a 0% chance they were going to collect any evidence from the car.  The check-in employee filled out an accident report form and gave me a form to go get a new car from the counter. Then back to the police station to file a report, took over an hour, basically the translator read my form out loud to a police officer who typed it in very slowly.  All in all I spent 4 hours in police stations to get a 3-page report and some good stories from the translator, while we were waiting for the officer. In retrospect I probably wouldn't have wasted half a day making the police report if I'd known it would only be EUR 115 and that it would take 6 hours total plus some hefty parking fees near the police station.  Was thinking at the time that the damage might be more like EUR 500 and that I would also file a homeowner's insurance claim for some of the stolen property (later decided not to, once we had sorted out what was stolen), so for EUR ~1000 seemed worth spending what I thought would be an hour or two getting the police report.  Didn't turn out that way. If I was doing it again for &lt;$200 I would definitely just exchange with Hertz, file the insurance claim without the police report (not even clear they needed it), and if it was denied just pay out of pocket.

When it is government mandated CDW coverage, Chase would cover the excess, PROVIDED you do NOT buy it down. The information you quoted, looks like Malaysia has mandatory CDW coverage with high excess, and the rental car company entices you to buy down the excess - once you do that, you LOSE any credit card coverage, be it Chase or Citi or AMEX. Note the key words of Nonwaivable,  (for the coverage), as well as \"buy down\" the excess which does not look buy it down much because you are still responsible for anywhere from 50% to 70% of the original excess! The excess is the maximum you would have to pay when you incur damages.  Usually the rental car company would charge that upfront, then you file claim to get most of it back if the claim is approved.  The excess itself ONLY for the actual repair cost, BEFORE taxes / excise fees / airport surcharges etc.  Those can be additional 30 to 40% of the excess.  Not all the add-on items are covered.  Airport surcharge on repair estimate is specifically NOT covered per the T&amp;Cs of benefits. Quote:", "Thanks.  I looked at Avis and it just says that it is included in the rate (not declinable), so it looks like basic CDW with excess is mandatory - other competitors like EuropCar also describe premium CDW as an excess reducing plan.   Since it looks like it is mandatory/nonwaivable, I guess the CSR CDW should kick in as a secondary.  Will sharing that screenshot with Chase be enough to prove that it is mandatory?", "You do NOT need to do anything.  The insurance provider KNOWS which country has mandatory CDW and process your claim accordingly.  Or if you still feel the need, you can google such as Does Malaysia require mandatory CDW coverage on rental car?  something like that and see what you can find and print.  Personally I would not be bothered. I have posted a very detailed report on a claim from our May 2018 trip at Sicily where we had some bad scratches to the car.  Italy is a mandatory CDW country, and is excluded from AMEX coverage in case you are not aware of this.  Chase covered the 1000 euro excess plus taxes and even paid a portion of the not-covered airport surcharges on the 1000 euro.  Go back to last year correspondent period to find my report - that should give anyone a very good idea on how to file eClaim (Chase's insurance handler) efficiently.  Our claim was settled extremely swiftly - from filing to money ACHed to our bank account, it took only 7 business days.  eClaim did not ask any extra doc nor even communicate to us after filing - the next email we received was to ask how we would like the money be paid.  (direct deposit via ACH or a check sent) One of the Key to have quick settlement is due to Budget at Catania airport being very efficient in processing the return, charge on the damage, and the supporting documents - all done within 10 min, with the docs emailed to us while we were in the return lot.  Then we spent 20 min back at the counter to get the Final Rental Agreement (required to file the claim) as well as to make sure the charges were all billed in Euro, not being DCCed to USD.  eClaim paid the exact amount of Budget's Damage Repair Invoice.", "Trying to figure out if my partner is covered. He's renting a vehicle in the UK and has to have the CDW with an excess of 1500$ due to the fact he is under 30 and vehicle type with Sixt. Would the Chase card cover the \u00a31500 if there was an accident? (it also states on the confirmation that the LDW with \u00a31500 excess is included in rate)", "Does the coverage terminate when the card is cancelled? To be more precise, if I rented a car (billed to Chase MP Explorer), it was damaged, and then cancel the card (because the annual fee is due), can I seek coverage after that?  What if I submit the claim, but then cancel the card after submitting the claim?", "Finally had my claim approved. Here's what happened: Went to Iceland back in August. Everything went fine until my last evening there when the wind was gusting up to 75 mph. At one of my final stops of the trip I happened to park in a way that the wind was blowing directly into the back of the vehicle so when I opened the door the wind caught it and slammed it forward causing damage. After that the door could only about 1/3rd of the way and even then with a bit of difficulty. The next morning I left about an hour earlier than I would have to get to Keflavik with enough time to fill out whatever I would need to fill out. Returning the car was fairly smooth and the agent handling the return made sure to give me email and hard copies of everything. On the layover on the way home I started the claim and submitted everything hoping for a speedy resolution. However, Card Benefit Services kept asking me to resubmit my rental voucher and contract claiming that the voucher I had submitted did not match. OK, I sent it again, and again, and again. I lost count but I think they asked for it a total of about 4 or 5 times. At this point I was getting frustrated and just decided to forget about it for a few weeks then tried again finally getting an approval. I'm not sure but I had made the booking using Auto Europe and I believe that there might have been an issue in that the actual rental contract showed Auto Europe's corporate account number even though I had used my CSR. I normally try to book directly but this time I could only seem to get this particular rate using the Auto Europe site. It ultimately took about 4 months from start to finish but that does include the couple of weeks where I got tired of dealing with it.", "May be you should read the T&amp;Cs in the benefit booklet?  if you dont have the paper pamphlet anymore, it is available on Chase site.", "I'll be going to New Zealand where they require basic insurance on the vehicle. From reading the above comments, it seems like Chase will help me pay for the excess (deductible) if I do get in an accident. Question I have is liability as the chase coverage is only for damages to my vehicle but not other vehicles. In New Zealand, the medical costs will be covered by ACC. But I do want to know if the basic insurance liability will cover the other parties vehicle? In the event that the basic insurance isn't enough, it'll be out of pocket on my end? Also, there seems to be an option for additional CDW and also protection for windshields, tires, and headlights. I plan to decline the additional CDW, but wanted to opt in for protection of windshields, tires, and headlights. Does chase cover protection for the windshields, tires, and headlights in the event they do get damaged? Not sure why Enterprise marks the coverage as not part of CDW?", "BEWARE of Chase car rental insurance as the underwriter CHUBB INc makes minimal attempts to identify where collision coverages NOT applicable. Chubb will list only advise countries like Republic of Ireland, Northern Iran , Israel, and Jamica are covered which basic VISA car insurance is not. However, there are many car agencies like around the world that require you purchase additional insurance which conflicts with CSR to deny all coverage. New Zealand along Italy, Australia, Iraq, Iran, etc etc...........are some of these countries where some card holders have had problems being told to buy additional insurance. Be careful --- I know I don't trust the limited knowledge of Chase Benefits staff on where insurance is applicable.", "Italy is a mandatory CDW country which AMEX has identified. Chase on the other hand the underwriter Chubb Inc refuses to document Italy or any of the other countries making many card holders confused. Suspect there are over 25 countries requiring mandatory additional insurance voiding the Chase insurance but chase won't support in identifying these countries.", "I would think you'd be okay if you can get the Benefits Administrator to send you a letter stating that the CDW is valid in the country you're visiting within a few weeks before leaving. (In fact, Irish car rental companies seem to want this to be willing to waive CDW at all from what I've read.) If you run into problems filing a claim later on, you can always send the letter you received along with the other required documents.", "Chase is very willing to issue a letter regarding the coverage.  Regarding countries where mandatory CDW is required by laws, Chase covers the excess.  We had one such claim at Italy, at Sicily to be exact.  I have posted the details last year - it was 7 calendar days from time to file the claim with eClaims online to the money ACHed to our bank account.  We even got reimbursed a little bit more because in the Repair Cost Estimate there were some airport surcharge added - this item is NOT covered, per the T&amp;Cs. At the time of picking up the car, Budget counter rep asked whether we would buy extra coverage to lower the excess which was $1000 euro before taxes.  We said no because the CC would cover it.  He then said, you understood that you would need to pay this first then you claimed it back from your credit card?  We answered it affirmative.  No more conversation on additional coverage topic. I also dont think in countries where the basic CDW is required by laws you could decline the basic coverage.  You can definitely decline the push to buy down the excess.  What the tactics some rental companies employed were to scare you on how high the excess would be, like up to the value of the car that kind of things, or tens of thousands of $.  This type of practice seems to be more prevailing with the non-worldwide chain, i.e. their names you never know about until you search car rental in that particular country.  Worldwide companies like Avis/Budget/Hertz/National/Enterprise, tend not to use such tactics even at franchisee locations.  Sixt is an exception that one needs to be really careful about due to many of the basic items they do not cover, without paying additional fee.

I asked why and that I had bought a GC there before, he just said that was what he was told. By who and when? No Answer.  I just dont understand this weird rule with Gas stations?! When home improvement is the category I can walk into any Lowes or Home Depot, go straight to the GC section, pick one up and go straight to the register and pay with my CF card and they dont even bat an eyelid. Zero problem! What sort of fraud are they worried about, my name is on the credit card and I can show my I.D. - What is the problem??? Are they operating under some urban myth of a scam that just isn't true?", "Yes, they are operating under an urban myth.  It is called \u201cprofit.\u201d", "Profit for who? Gas station or credit card company?", "It doesn\u0092t really matter which one, or both.  Neither wants a sale with no profit.", "Well in the case of the gas station it could be that they dont want to pay the credit card transaction fee on a non-profit sale, but if so, why dont they just say that? They're usually franchises owned by a small business person so I get that. However, none of the workers or managers there can seem to give a reason other than its some vague rule that they were told by someone. Even with cash purchase of GC's are they making a profit? Why do gas stations carry GC's at all then? Do they in fact get a piece of a GC sale? I dont know but it would be interesting to find out. In the case of the credit card company part of the reason I have one of their premium credit cards is for the points transfer perks. It their cost of doing business and competing with other credit card issuers. I didnt create the game I just play it. If its their rule well then I guess some people are getting around it by searching for a gas station that doesnt care about either scenario. The urban myth part of my comment above was that it seems that there is some feeling of it being a scam to buy GC's with a credit card which is false. I suppose someone could steal a credit card and then immediately go make a big GC purchase but just a minimal amount of verification of identity would solve that concern.", "Why would you expect a clerk in a gas station to understand (and be able or willing to explain to you) the owner\u0092s business model?

I wouldn't want to if given the choice. However, it makes me really think about some of the backlash. Are travel credit cards right for you if you buy them to \"break even?\" Is $100 the make or break for potentially many more times that in value? Are there legitimate alternatives that might work better for an individual, or are we just mad at the change? To me, it seems like jumping to the Citi ecosystem is a knee-jerk reaction. If the math works out for you, then it works. However, the 4th night free is extremely overrated (even more so if you have a bunch of hotel credit cards) and the effective annual fee is still $245 (same as the CSR). If you spend a lot in air travel and restaurants (which it doesn't sound like you do) then it might be the card for you. I just can't get behind this card. While we all want 5x bonus categories, I feel this card does it to make up for the weak overall value it presents. If I was to move anywhere, it would probably be to the AMEX Gold. For me, while disappointing, one of the main reasons I chose the CSR is because I get many times the value back of what I put into it quite easily. CFU, CIC, and CF all bring some big returns that the CSR can't do on its own and that you aren't getting elsewhere. For example, I almost spend as much a year on cell phone, cable, and streaming services (all 5X) than I do on airfare, and that's even after greatly scaling back on those services.  I am not one who likes all of the effort and choices required to redeem credits and stuff. I get that. It was one of the primary reasons I did not go to the AMEX system.

The card has been good for me-- I spend a significant amount each year on travel and restaurants, and have been able to take advantage of the PP membership since i'm often travelling international economy.   I'm also a great customer for Chase, since I tend to put most of my spend on the card (not just travel and restaurants), so they're making out on the interchange fees on my non bonused spend.  What I'm no longer sure about is the value of the points I'm acquiring-- in general it has been getting harder to find decent valued award redemptions, and I've been hearing that the chase travel portal doesn't offer the full range of choices that one would find on expedia or some similar engine.  That said, my preliminary looking around isn't making me feel like there's another card that would be better-- certainly there are some decent offerings from citi and amex, but then you're locked into their travel portals or their set of transfer partners as well.  The effect of the $100 fee increase has been for me to think more closely about the value I'm getting from the card, and whether I should be looking at alternatives.

They did an escallation but said the escallation team might not respond for days. I have another ticket booked for tomorrow on DL but the UA routing has better times. People clearly rely on the instant transfers, and it is maddening that Chase reps have no information as to why the transfer is not working and they don't have a way to interface with the back office teams that handle the transfers. Chase (and any other large company) treats you like garbage whether you have a food stamps card or a Sapphire card; same difference; if you try to step out of their scripted answers, for which they have no explanations or help.  The reps don't have any resources besides the scripted answers they give like bots. What if someone was transferring miles to see someone that was terminally ill, it sounds like there is nothing Chase would do!

So infuriating.", "For those of you who have had delayed transfers, I'm wondering about the timing of the emails from Chase.

Did everyone get an email telling them the transfer was completed when it finally was?

I got the email stating transfer was complete at 9:02 a.m. this morning, precisely 13 hours and 15 minutes after it was initiated. This has no rhyme and reason. The awards I booked last night are actually still wide open but there was no way for me to have known that. My ideal outbound flights had no longer been available by the time I finalized my plans and I didn't want this ideal return flight to disappear on me too.

Monthly Uber credits = some tangible value but I use Uber sporadically so would never max out. Marriott Gold or Hyatt Explorist status = zero tangible value, no real perks of value. If AF is not &lt; tangible benefits then card is cancelled a year after signup bonus received.  Quote: No, what I said was CPC customers like me (who don't have millions under management) will flee if they are relegated to an inferior product like CSR.

The only UR card I have is the Sapphire Preferred. I am of a mind to close/downgrade it. The earn rate is poor and I find myself none too happy to reach for it compared to the other options in my wallet (Amex EDP, BBP, Bonvoy, Citi TYPremier, Citi AA Plat, BofA Cash, etc) - one or more of which always offer better or equal earning. I have never found UR to be particularly superior to other currencies - no knocks intended here, but just based on my usage. I am also aware I could change up to Reserve, but I am not an aggressive churner &amp; am quite happy to wait for the 48-mo period to expire and take in a signup bonus on that then. There's plenty of other bonuses to earn in the meanwhile and at my rate I won't exhaust interesting options soon. So, without any specific near term redemptions in mind, which of these 3 would you think I should transfer out my UR to (and close the Preferred), as downgrading to any of the Freedoms is not a good UR-backup strategy for me (it will be a while before I sign up for the Reserve &amp; the points could get locked out for any number of reasons in that time)? -  United, Southwest, or Hyatt? Those are the 3 unique partners and historically considered a good value. The others are to be found on either Citi or Amex or otherwise (which I still retain). Earlier, I would have totally overlooked Southwest, as the value is fixed (albeit decent) &amp; I rarely even use them. But now, with United's program shenanigans &amp; my relative unfamiliarity with value to be gleaned there, I include it. The question is really determined largely by whether there is International Business award value to be found on *A partners any longer with MileagePlus. If so (let's say reasonably consistent @ substantially better than 1.5c), then it's still United. If not, it's a toss-up between Southwest &amp; Hyatt. I will find some use for either sooner or later. Does anyone see strong near term devaluation potential @ Hyatt?

I flew to New York a bit before New Year's. 2 of us flew RT on Delta for 29,000 points through UR portal. By far and away the cheapest option I found. Yet, to many people on this site, I didn't do \"well enough\" because it was at a 1.5 valuation. I don't need to waste  75,000 points so I can get a \"higher valuation\". Then our next flight, Southwest was by far the cheapest, which isn't on UR. My next flight, is just me, and had the most convenient timing/price, Frontier was my best bet. $180 RT with baggage, paid out of pocket.

IAH-BOG was diverted to PTY for a night due to volcanic activity near BOG. Took the airline voucher for the hotel as it was a decent one, but (1) bought a jacket/toiletries from a nearby mall (was pouring in PTY) and (2) had a nice room service dinner and breakfast the next day - total ~US$400. All was reimbursed by Chase. Then later on the same ticket, my EWR-SYR flight was hit with rolling delays before an ultimate cancellation, with no flights available to any nearby airports that night. The PH NYC had just opened and I found a points + cash rate available for that night, with the cash component being $300.

I couldn't get the exact reason out of the agent so I wasn't going to try to go nuts with the room like some people have in this thread. I called Frontier to get the cancellation reason and they tried sending me the same form that I had been emailed and also given at the airport.

It wasn't until I message Customer Service via their website that I got an email stating that the reason for the delay was \"Unexpected Maintenance.\" I printed that email to PDF and that was the last thing I got to upload Dec 1(again I had emailed it to them two weeks ago as well).

My rental and gas was only about $38 total so two Ubers would have definitely cost more.

I claimed Mon Ami Gabi in the Paris for lunch (about $60 with tip) and Dinner at the Oyster Bar restaurant in Harrah's (about $24 with tip). I also claimed some beverages, $50 in clothes, and an Uber home. About $260 total. They reimbursed the tips (most in the thread have reported the same, but I believe there a few data points where people had that deducted from their claim). This trip delay insurance is a great benefit. I actually hope I get a covered delay in the future. If I hadn't had an eating contest the day I returned, I would have eaten more (though it might have cost them less as I might have just gone to the Wicked Spoon Buffet at Cosmo, or I might have added another meal).

Wife goes to Vons and tries to make the purchase (one hour later), but card not honored AGAIN this year.  The first year, okay as she did not call first.  The second year angry, as she called first.  This year really embarrassed as a lot of people were giving her the \"poor old lady\" overspent her card look.  Vons tried to process twice.  Meantime I got an alert on our pc (I was home) that the card had been declined and was it okay to allow it.  I replied YES to both.  I then called my wife's cell and left a message.  She was trying to call Chase but was put on infinite hold.  Bottom line, the clerk at Vons decided to split the purchase into two smaller purchases.   The first went thru ($500), the second did not.  Wife eventually used a different card for the balance of the purchase.  This complicated the Vons points we were to get with the gift cards purchase (a different issue, but Vons called \"headquarters\" and we got our points a hour later). When she got home, she was really upset.  I told her to call Chase and tell them what happen and ask for a waiver of the card fee for one year, after three years of hassle and embarrassment.  She called.  Gave the operator the ladies name at Chase that she talked to.  Chase is sorry but cannot provide anything more.   Transferred to customer retention.  Asked for waiver of card fee.  No deal.  Asked for UA points.  No deal.  So after being a card holder for more than 3 decades she cancelled!   I, hubby, have card too.  We use her card for UA Flight purchase, baggage check, boarding line status (when not in Business) and historically to get the \"free club passes\" which we seldom use, as we are usually in business international, and seldom can use the club before our domestic departure.  Up until the last few years those passes were gifted on FT.  Now they are electronic and mostly just die.  In the near future we will just use my card when flying UA.

Also - don't forget, when you earn miles from credit card, while the airline profits from the bank, a liability is also created for the outstanding miles.

It's the bureaus (EQ/EX/TU) who combine pulls if they can't tell them apart.  The pull only includes information about the issuer and the date, and so if two pulls come in looking the same with the same date, the bureau can't be sure whether they're duplicates or not, so they don't count these potential duplicates. The reason business and personal pulls don't combine at most banks is because the bureau can tell them apart, because the issuer puts info in there that's different for personal apps than for business apps, because they're handled by a different group of offices within the bank.  So a bank A personal pull might come into the bureau saying something like \"bank A consumer services\" while a bank A business pull might come into bureau saying something like \"bank A business services\".  The bureau can't tell two \"bank A consumer services\" pulls apart from each other that have the same date, but it certainly can tell there difference between \"personal\" and \"business\".  (The actual IDs of two groups within the bank may be very different -- they could be alphanumeric mumbo jumbo, for all I know -- but the illustration is just to make clear that they are different enough to not have any risk of being duplicates of each other.)   bgriffin likes this.", "We have plenty of data points (in the Applying thread) that show that for whatever unknown reason, Chase evaluates 5/24 by looking at your credit report and nothing else (specifically, nothing within Chase's databases).
