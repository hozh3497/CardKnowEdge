Since I've never tried to do that \"commute\" between the terminal, I am not sure if your 2 hours connection is enough but it seems a bit tight.

Centurion has an good but not wide selection of alcohol, felt like less variety than their other lounges. As of yesterday, all alcohol at Escape is free for Plat cardholders, including some surprisingly high-end brands. Port Charlotte scotch is served in the Centurion ($80/bottle it looks like). Standard coffee/espresso machines in both lounges, but Escape has a traditional espresso machine behind the bar for handmade drinks as well as 6 types of tea out (didn't see a tea section at Centurion, but I didn't look too hard for it). Decor at Escape was slightly better than Centurion IMO, Centurion felt a bit sterile to me, especially the bar and food section. Runway views available at both lounges. Overall, both good additions to the Amex network. If I was going back, I'd lean towards the Escape lounge unless I was really hungry.

The Escape should join Priority Pass and make it exclusive to Priority Pass and keep the AMEX Lounge for AMEX Cardholders.

I haven't been to either yet, but I look forward to seeing comparisons and hopefully making them for myself one day.

There is a dining room between the two that can be for either, but is partitioned off so only one lounge can access it at a time.

The Escape one is presented slightly better, but the Centurion is definitely the preferred choice for someone who is hungry. I did notice a basic charcuterie tray at the Escape lounge that the Amex lounge lacked. Alcohol: Escape has a basic level for most people (standard lounge fare - Jack/Bacardi/Walker Red/etc.) and then more premium labels that as of Wednesday are free for Amex cardholders (Basil Haydens, Makers, Ketel One, Hendricks, etc.). There is a bottle of Walker Blue Label there that is free for now, but I do not expect that to ever be re-ordered.

We were able to work through the process with GIO Canada, the independent 3rd party dispute resolution process in Canada for complaints against insurers. After much back and forth with them, they agreed to move our claim to mediation with the insurer. Within days of agreeing to move to mediation, GIO contacted us to notify us that the insurer had agreed to pay us for the entire cost of the claim against them to fully settle it. That was a few weeks ago, but we're still waiting to hear about a final resolution. Fingers crossed that it comes through and everything is sorted out as we're almost 10 months into this. For anyone else dealing with GIO in the future for this, or any other dispute, I recommend being firm and continually following-up to get your claim to move forward.

I would have expected Amex Plat and Centurion to be a bit clearer about the exclusions, no matter where you live. I understand the argument that many people have here about reading the insurance certificate, but I consider myself to be fairly savvy and to have read the insurance certificate in the past. But it's next to impossible to remember the specifically excluded vehicles, or what's considered exotic, without carrying the amex certificate of insurance with you everywhere haha.

They had Confirmation numbers, assigned seats, everything but a boarding pass. Get to the airport and are told their itinerary was never completely ticketed and they need to contact AmEx travel. Spend 30 minutes on hold with AmEx travel before they finally get someone on the phone, but by then it\u0092s too late and they\u0092re missing their flight. Spend the next three hours on the phone with AmEx travel to no avail trying to get a decent routing that doesn\u0092t eat up multiple days of their trip before finally deciding to book an $800 cash fare on B6/SA TPA-JFK-JNB tomorrow morning. Lucky for them the fare mysteriously plummeted in price from $3000 to $800 around 9:30PM. Now they\u0092re trying to work with AmEx travel to get the return flight \u0093reinstated\u0094. Does anyone have insight into likely outcomes here? I haven\u0092t spoken with them on the phone to determine whether or not AmEx is taking responsibility for the issue. Based on my understanding of ticketing, I\u0092m struggling to come up with a scenario where AmEx honors the flight home if they aren\u0092t utilizing an AmEx ticket on the outbound. Seems like they\u0092re going to get a refund at best and be stuck buying a close-in one-way home. Anyone have insight they can provide on how this might be handled?", "Was the primary cardholder also one of the passengers ticketed for the flight itinerary? Whom are they speaking with on the phone for 3 hours that can't get a manager or floor supervisor on the phone to find an answer? Generally anytime I book an itinerary through amex travel, be it hotel or flight (using MR), they will immediately debit the cash value from the card, then proceed to process the points equivalent and give statement credits within 24-48 hours. So that is typically a paper trail I look for, and confirmation numbers are furnished in email virtually immediately. If the cardholder has email proof of the confirmation number (print out/digital), or a valid confirmation number inside AMEX's system, It would be pretty difficult for them not to accept responsibility, unless I am missing something. Entire thing sounds like a massive nightmare, wish them luck.", "It sounds to me like they had a reservation but the ticket was never issued. The key question is whether there ever was a ticket receipt showing a ticket number, not just some confirmation number. If they had tried to do OLCI (ideally well before going to the airport) but weren't able to get boarding passes, this should be a red flag that someone needed to call AmEx travel and/or the airline ASAP. BTW, what part of AmEx Travel was used? I've never had such a long wait to reach PTS by phone and the agents usually seem very competent.", "First question is whether your friends each had an e-ticket number.  Not a confirmation or itinerary, but an e-ticket.  If they have an Amex confirmation # and not an e-ticket, then it really is on Amex to get them home.  Whether Amex does that by using its back channels to get the original reservation reinstated and at the price it would have paid or by some other means is not your friends' concern. Getting all of this done is going to take a lot of time, patience and Skype.   Any chance that $800 fare is available on the way back?  If so, might seem to be a great deal and might be an outstanding result. For the benefit of others, always check that you have e-tickets with a 17-digit e-ticket number covering all segments of the itinerary.  It takes about 30 seconds to review what typically arrives via email or which can be pulled up online from the ticketing carrier.  Never rely on any other document as it is the e-ticket which the carrier uses to get paid.", "My experience with them is you have to watch like a hawk to make sure it gets ticketed.

Another data point, I have probably visited about 40+ Delta SkyClubs this year and I have only heard those same comments TWICE.

The fine print says the MQM won't be added for 4-8 weeks! What the hay! How is that going to help him?? Why did she tell us that would take care of it?? Does it truly aways take that long even if we do the spend right away AND pay it off right away?? I'm thinking with hong kong trips, the eventual 5KMQM, the rollovers and him spending on the card he can up the status quickly, but mid year??", "Where do you see this? In any event, the issue is whether the MQM's count for the year in which they are earned, or the year in which they are posted. Quote:", "You may still have a chance of it posting before the end of the year.  In my experience, the bonus tends to post within a few days of the spending goal being reached.  The only time I've run into the \"4-8 weeks\" language is when I know there's something wrong with the transaction but they make me wait 8 weeks anyway.  Perhaps others can provide some data points.", "Mia, sorry, not 8 but 12, you are correct. So my plan is to see the approval, pay off all of our insurance accounts and then pay off the card all within 2 days. I'll call AMX and ask them about getting those MQMs posted before year's end. Thank you!", "As I've understood it from other threads, as long as the spend posts to Amex by December 31 (so potentially up to a week after the purchase), the MQMs are backdated to 2019 and 2020 status and rollover are recalculated.  Also relevant is that the status in force for benefit purposes in 2019 carries through January 2020 (largely to allow for delayed adjustments like ORC etc.). In that case (and if I've been understanding these threads properly), this could happen * finish 2019 with 45,200 MQM * start 2020 with Silver status and 20,200 MQM, but still enjoying Platinum benefits (I think I got from your post that he had Platinum for 2019) * if Amex posts the 5k MQM by January 31, that turns into Gold status and 200 MQM plus earnings from 2020 flights * if the posting is further delayed into February, then it's Silver status and 20,200 MQM plus earnings from 2020 flights until the Gold status in the previous bullet point kicks in One interesting question would be if it's possible in the last scenario to get bonus RDM that you would have earned on flights in that February interim period of Silver credited or have any fees that would have been waived for a Gold in that period refunded.", "Yes in deed! That is an interesting question I will post an update as this scenario plays out. He was only able to thaw two out of three of his credit freezes so they did not give an instantaneous approval. I finally got all three done so hopefully the approval will come through quickly", "NO. The question isn't when AmEx posts the MQMs to the DL FF account but whether the 5,000 MQMs will count for 2019 or 2020. The threshold spend MQMs (10,000 MQMs for a $25,000 spend on the DL Plat card and 15,000 MQMs for $30,000 spend on the Reserve card) count spend by the calendar year and even if the miles for 2019 spend are credited in 2020, they will count as 2019 miles for status and rollover purposes. Whether the miles post by January 31st or not is irrelevant. If they're 2019 miles, he gets GM through January 31, 2021 assuming that the MQD requirement is met. If they're 2020 miles, he'll be FO until a higher status is earned. With DL one earns status on a CALENDAR year basis but the previous year's status is retained through January 31st to allow late posting stuff to be credited to the account before people lose status.", "As I just stated in my post above (where I forgot to quote this post), some of the information in this post is wrong.", "I'm not sure there's any discrepancy between what we've posted.  If the 2019 MQMs don't hit Delta until after January 31, for flights in the period between February 1 and when the 2019 MQMs hit DL one would be flying with the Silver status had absent those 2019 MQMs.", "OH gosh yall...I'm sooo confused. So If he has 45K MQM (and the dollar spend was already done) on December 31, 2019 but he is currently Platinum from the previous years miles, then he goes into 2020 as silver after plat ends Feb 1.  THEN...say, sometimes in late January those 5K MQMs post, they'll go into the 2020 box of miles that will determine the following years status AND the current year IF he flies enough to gain MQMs and that spend happens.   Right? OR... He gets credited with the 5K MQMs in late Dec 2019, ends December 31, 2019 with 50K MQMs, he goes into 2020 as a gold after his platinum status ends Fed 1. But if he flies and flies and spends and spends can he progress up to Platinum mid year? I think my head hurts.", "MSPeconomist is definitely correct insofar as the threshold bonus on each 25k (or 30k for the Reserve card). The 5k sign-up bonus *probably* follows the same December 31 \"spend\" deadline (and not when the miles actually post). As a side note, it always comes up that someone spends on December 31, and the merchant posts the sale to Amex on Jan 1. In that case, the MQM's will towards a threshold bonus in 2020, not 2019. As past years go, our Skymiles MQM balances in January will be nonsensical until Delta's computers catch up. Negative balances when Delta deletes the MQM's for 2020 status. MQM's post to a flyer's account at the close of his or her billing cycle. Quite possible for someone to not get their earned status on Delta.com until end of January or even early February. But the general point is correct that the status update *should* backdate to January 1. No idea if Delta will handle the timing of the 5k MQM bonus per the OP's question automatically, or whether OP will need to ask Delta to make a correction in February -- assuming the MQM's wrongly credit for 2020. Same for missed RDM bonuses for January flights taken before the new status is recognized. In any case, I'd give Delta until February to sort this out.", "Yes, you do pose a lot of things to think about. My plan is to spend the $3K immediately and pay it off as soon as the charge posts. We'll just go from there. I will update every on what happens.", "Same issue    Same issue here. I hit the spend threshold last week and paid it immediately and I need the MQMs to count for 19 to keep my status in 20.  I looked at my delta account and my miles from AmEx seem to hit on the 10th of the following month. So I hit threshold in early December, pay in early December but likely that miles likely not credited until 1/10/20. Going to be really pissed if they don\u0092t count toward 19 as I was prepaying bill, buying gift cards etc to hit the threshold by year end. Ugh!", "Is this the welcome bonus for a *new* DL AmEx card or not? If you're talking about the annual threshold MQM bonuses (10,000 MQMs for $25,000 and $50,000 on DL Plat card and 15,000 MQMs for $30,000 and $60,000 spend on the reserve card, to be changed somewhat in 2020), please don't worry as spend that POSTS TO YOUR CREDIT CARD during the calendar year (regardless of your billing cycle and regardless of when you pay providing that your AmEx accounts remain in good standing) will lead to MQMs that count for that calendar year, 2019 in your case. For such MQMs, DL backdates them to the calendar year in which the spend threshold was reached regardless of when they actually hit your FF account. The question here concerns the initial welcome bonus offers that the Plat and Reserve card generally carry for new and upgraded accounts, typically something like 5,000 MQMs for perhaps $3000-$10,000 spend during the first several months. For *these* MQMs, there's a question of whether spend depends on the calendar year or one's own billing cycle for the purpose of determining whether the WELCOME BONUS MQMS (and only these welcome bonus one time MQMs) will count as having been earning in 2019 or 2020.", "This is strictly concerning the bonus MQMs and whether they will be credited towards the 2020 status if bonus requirements are met in Dec.

If you scheduled a payment in advance on the Amex website, you should be able to cancel it without repercussion if you do so before the deadline.  After the deadline, there's no way to cancel it.  The same would be true of a bank's bill pay service.   What I suspect is meant by \"cancel\" is something that caused the payment to be returned by the bank unpaid.  It could be a bank bill pay check that was sent out and then the customer put in a \"stop payment\" request.  Or, it could be an ACH transaction that they disputed and had sent back unpaid (generated either by bank BillPay, or from the Amex website).  In any of those situations, it would be a matter of a payment actually being submitted to the customer's bank and then being returned unpaid.  Even before the recent anti-money-laundering crackdowns that others have mentioned, creditors have for a long time been very uncomfortable with any situation that results in a payment being returned unpaid, much more so than late payments, and even in the case where the money wasn't even owed.  For whatever reason, it just makes them nervous.

She said that it was \"no problem\" if the payment didn't go through (two separate reps actually told me this) so I moved some of the cash out of that checking account so the payment wouldn't go through. It didn't, but then they immediately cancelled my account. If I thought they were going to do this, I would have just made the payment.

The SDL for the high balance team would have far more scrutiny on their portfolio for customer satisfaction given the HB team is often dealing with celebrities, CEOs and executives, successful business owners, etc. Not everyone who has an account with this team is a Centurion (a lot of high balance cardholders don't see any benefit in the Centurion program or its fees). So....all of that being said...the OP needs to call back, get a supervisor and find out if his former account(s) were managed by the high balance team, and if so, try and get with a supervisor to review the matter with the group's SDL. If it's not the high balance team, it will be the general 'credit' team, and every group within Amex be it credit, high balance, high risk, government, etc etc will all have a SDL, and above them, a director who owns that division - the point being, there are a lot of escalation options to try and get everything put back to where it was before.

In the modern era, you should have credit monitoring in place considering all of the breaches lately as places like Experian with troves of credit data (and others). If you see something that is a problem you can work with your credit monitoring protection to get it corrected (stuff such as opening CC accounts you never opened, etc.). Stuff like reward point fraud is small potatoes because the bank is what's on the hook here. If someone fraudulently took all of your MR points then Amex can, and would, give you back those stolen points. Since they value them at 1 cent a point the fraud loss to them would be extremely small compared to someone stealing your card and testing out your \"no credit limit\" bounds. But in either case, they are playing with Amex's money not yours. So if Amex isn't worried I wouldn't be either...
