And so if AA can misunderstand the various ways that some people can be able to apply for multiples of the same Citi card without \"mailer abuse\" (and do rash things like terminate people's accounts based on that misunderstanding), I fear that they could misunderstand how someone could get multiples of the same Barclay card in 2 or 3 years if that were possible through some other \"loophole\".

They came back with two utterly bizarre recommendations for breakfast -- \"Tea for Two\", a British high tea spot, and \"Cafe Flandes\" which is supposedly a Dutch-style coffee shop. \"Tea for Two\" wasn't even open on the days we were there, due to vacation schedules. We decided to try \"Cafe Flandes\" to see what it was about -- which wasn't much. It was literally diner food, not horrible but nothing other than completely mediocre. Also: how odd is it to recommend a British place and what amounts to basically just some random diner when we are traveling in Spain? Were they terrified of recommending anything local or authentic or even basically high quality? Asked Amex Platinum Concierge to give us recommendations for moderately priced restaurants in Valencia and Barcelona, our next two destinations. In Valencia they recommended a couple spots near the train station we were going to use. The first was Sagardi Valencia Centro, a perfect spot a short walk from the train, which they described as \"for years the great reference of Basque cuisine in Valencia\". It was simultaneously quite affordable and superb -- everything from the ambience to the service to the food itself -- stupendous, and something we wouldn't have easily found by Yelp searches. It was also across from some amazing medieval architecture which we also loved looking at as we dined. Barcelona was a bit more of a mixed success. Their primary restaurant recommendation was awesome -- Cera 23. There were some issues though -- the whole thing is happening during the holidays and when I tried to make reservations after receiving their recommendations, nothing was available until very late in the evening (10:30pm). I asked them to try to reschedule and/or get a reservation at another restaurant but they didn't even look at my email for over a day. By then there were no options left. It appears that email responses and emailed requests get low priority, even when responding to an email they sent. In future whenever I need to do anything with the concierge, I will call, not email, if I can. The other thing is Cera 23 is in a rough neighborhood of Barcelona. It was fine for us -- we like to go to places more on the \"edgy\" side and this place perfectly fit our preferences. I wonder if this is something they somehow figured out from my profile or if they knew it. I didn't mention anything like that when I contacted them, On the other hand, if they give this recommendation to a lot of people I imagine some might find the place a little intimidating. We had a fabulous time, however, at Cera 23 and were suitably impressed with both the quality of their recommendations and how well they happened to suit our mood and taste, based on very little hinting from me. The contrast, however, with the awful Visa Infinite concierge was immense. It may be that Amex isn't always able to pull off restaurant reservation miracles --- but even just putting together a cool itinerary was itself pretty amazing.

Funny thing is, I anticipated their failure and got online at about 1 AM Spain time and booked a backup reservation at the same restaurant.  That tells me that 1) Amex missed the midnight deadline and 2) they missed it by a pretty wide margin. I think I'm going to cancel my Biz Plat card at this point.

On the same Spain trip I had a good experience with above, they also forgot to respond to an emailed request in a timely manner and only \u0093noticed\u0094 it when I sent another request to remind them. Etc. So they\u0092re really not a reliable \u0093personal assistant\u0094; maybe they used to be in the past but certainly not these days.

However since I don\u0092t rely on them for anything critical I\u0092m still getting value out of it. It\u0092s easier to maximize the credits on the personal card anyway so for $50/year why not?

A few months ago I bought tickets to a show through Telecharge using my AmEx platinum card. Because of a disability, I need an aisle seat, so that is what I bought. I bought the tickets a year in advance as the show is likely to be very popular (it won't start until next fall.) Three months after I bought the tickets, I was browsing the Telecharge site and noticed that my tickets weren't on the aisle. The seating chart had been inexplicably changed. I called Telecharge and they were able to move me over two seats to the aisle, but I had to also choose a different day, which was fine. I also ended up having to pay more because the pricing had gone up - which didn't seem right but whatever. Then about two weeks after that, an announcement was issued that that the venue had been changed and now my *second* sets of seat were no longer on the aisle. It was impossible to get through to Telecharge this time, so since I had bought these with AmEx Platinum, I decided to call the concierge line to see if they could help this time. They said that they would reach out to Telecharge for me as they have an internal group that deals with them. The result was that they got me back on the aisle, but in the back of the section *and* I had to again pay more since the price of the seats had gone up again. They told me that I was best off securing these seats so I had *something* on the aisle but that they would try to get me closer to where I was going to sit initially. It has now been six weeks since that first call. I keep getting emails from AmEx (from different people - there was one person working on it for about three weeks and she seems to have disappeared, so now it's different people each time) that they are \"working on it\" and meanwhile, I'm sure all those new aisle seats that popped up when the venue changed are being sold if not sold already. I did try to call Telecharge again myself, but they told me that since AmEx had contacted them, they were working directly with AmEx and that there was nothing they could do for me - that I should continue to work through AmEx. These two tickets were close to $500 once I paid twice more each time my seats were changed. Going in and buying a whole new set isn't really an option - and I think they have also hiked up the price significantly since I initially bought (which is probably why they don't want to give me seats like I initially had). I know I will see the show and I do have an aisle seat in the back, but it doesn't seem right or fair. I know the theatre change is not AmEx's fault but I am so disappointed that, using their concierge service, I was asked to pay more money for worse seats and that they have not been able to help me with something that doesn't seem like a crazy request - but I'm happy to hear opinions/suggestions about this. (I don't have a Twitter so I won't be Tweeting anyone to complain - in fact, I'm not great at the public complaining thing in general...) Thank you for any thoughts. P.S.  I think this probably belongs in the AmEx forum but I don't know how to move and don't want to repeat post.  Hopefully a moderator can move it.  Thanks in advance.", "I'm sorry to hear about your experience, but I doubt there is much that Amex can or will do.

I mostly have no issues with my preferred card (CSR), but did use the A+ a couple of times for unattended ticket vending machines last year. I was curious to see if it would accept my PIN (it did); I did not compare with the CSR at the time. I still have the Aviator Red card (with the same PIN behavior, I believe).

WN may introduce fees of some type. anyone here going to buy thousands of $ for WN flights in 2020?", "I'm guessing WN is fine with the quick cancellation of flights and having the refund as a Travel Fund. They get paid the full amount, minus credit card fees. Sure, there's a very minor burden on their reservation systems, but worth the extra revenue. It's Amex that might decide to clamp down. Amex is better off if the airline statement credit goes unused. They might demand that WN code all ticket purchases -- even those under $100 -- as such, so that Amex doesn't credit any of them. It's hard to know on the outside how burdensome this would be on WN, and whether there's enough money involved to justify the effort. As many have observed on FlyerTalk, we are far from the norm among the traveling public. Only a tiny portion would ever go to the trouble of learning this end-around and exploiting it. Amex might figure that it's not worth it to play another cat-and-mouse game with the likes of us. Pretty good chance we'll just find another loophole.
