Fresh experience from being a peddler of the Rewards+ card is why I knew what to make about the merits of a  claim about CLI requests on very young Citicard accounts. Otherwise, absent correction from an experienced party inside or outside of Citi, I would have probably been under the impression that such young accounts had very little chance for a CLI to happen upon customer request for a CLI (at least for those whose  income and housing costs remained constant during the period between card application time and CLI request times)..", "I would have thought the same since Citi has historically been a fairly conservative lender, (but perhaps that's limited only to the sub-prime customer market).", "Whether a CL increase will be approved depends on many factors.

An issuer may also grant a temporary increase for a specific purchase.  While that may not be useful in many settings, it can be quite useful for someone who has other major credit-impacting activities on the horizon, such as a real estate closing. If OP has any concerns about whether a CL will be approved, it is worth the time to call in and explore options.  It certainly doesn't help to get a $1K increase if you need $10K, so the call becomes worth the effort.", "50% increase of the CL within 90 days of account opening being done without a hard hit on the CR hasn\u2019t been unusual for some of the no-annual-fee Citicards issued in recent months.

Around 12/10 I saw that one direction opened in a better class and called in to change that award.  Change made via phone and the process was that the miles would be returned to my account and then the new quantity of miles deducted.  Miles were returned but never taken back out.

Again, miles for this trip have not been taken back out of. Y account.i had another transpacific flight on a different partner on request.

What the partner sees now is the old class or the upgraded class?Did you have a NEW eticket emailed to you? When the partner confirmed your booking, what ticket number the partner sees at their end?

If the partner has a new ticket number, and the class of service is upgraded, then a new ticket is reissued but the process of deducting the miles was derailed by the status of account being locked.

We're trying to help but can't offer meaningful advice without answers to specific questions you're not answering. 1. Did you apply for this card through (a) a public offer (found on Citi or AA website or a blog, for example) or (b) a mail or email offer you received from Citi or AA? 2. If the answer to 1. above is (b), do you still have the email/mail offer? If so, look carefully for any language stating something to the effect that American Airlines miles are not available if you received a new account bonus for [whatever flavor of card this is] in the past 48 months. 3. If your answer to 1. is (a) or your answer to 2. is \"yes there is such 48 month language\" then the next question is for you to confirm whether you did have this same AA card previously and if so, when the bonus posted. If you still have that card open, you should be able to go back through statement history to check.  4. If your answer to 1. is (b) and you're certain there is no such restrictive language in the targeted offer you received, then it shouldn't matter when or if you had a prior bonus.", "The lack of clear answers to simple questions on repeated occasions over a period of days suggests that there is more to this than is being revealed.

The 40k miles offer is likely the one on their website which 100% has the language.  If it really didn\u2019t have the language then you could file a complaint against Citi and they\u2019d almost certainly give the bonus miles. However, AA might just terminate your account and at that point it doesn\u2019t matter if you bonus was for 10M miles.", "This may well be part of the AA crackdown. It struck me that the sudden and mysterious approach smacked of one of Citi's bank regulators having raised the issue of dangling too many bonuses in front of people who had no economic need for another card. If that is the case, it would make all the sense in the world for Citi to crack down on its underwriting. As noted above, it would do little good, in any event, to have Citi issue the card with the bonus, only to have AA credit the bonus and then close and zero out the account. OP has not supplied any details, so not much to be said.  Did he have another card and when?", "We need more details: - When did you previously hold (or still hold) the card and was/is it the exact same card product?  Citi's current time limitation is 48 months from when you last received a sign-up bonus for the exact card product.  (Previously it was 24 months based on the card \"family\").  So having held a \"similar\" card isn't the same, nor applicable to the current T&amp;Cs. - The above assumes that the offer under which you applied had the 48-month language, which all public links AFAIK have.  If you had a targeted offer without the restriction, then it obviously wouldn't apply.  Did you use a targeted offer (mailer for example) or a general public link?  Do you still have the link or offer to read its terms? - What prompted the telephone conversation?  Citi frontline CSRs are notoriously uninformed and unreliable, so if this was a comment made during card activation for example, I wouldn't take it as gospel on its own.", "Relax on the AA-conspiracy theory folks.  OP creates account today and their first post, with no further info or replies so far.

Standard practice had been to keep cards open for more frequent apps, while reducing their respective CLs to increase odds of auto-approval--this was assuming one's Fico score could withstand such tinkering.

AF will be due in January. We have no problem getting the travel credit, and we could probably still use the 4th night free even with the new restrictions, but it seems silly to have too many $450+ AF cards, and the insurance changes to the Prestige really hurt (travel insurance is one thing, but we also rent cars a lot but don't have car insurance because we live in a city and don't own a personal car). Am I missing something if I cancel and switch to CSR or Amex Platinum (if we even want to keep a high-fee card?). Thanks!", "I don't think you are missing anything if you drop Prestige for CSR, but from my perspective if you can use the 4th night free benefit, this card becomes pretty close to net-0 cost.  Why not keep it and also get CSR for rental car coverage?  High AF cards are not really high fee if the net cost is close to zero.  I have Prestige, Amex Plat and soon CSR.  Amex plat is the only one I'd consider dropping because using the benefits are so difficult.  I even have the Amex Gold and I'd sooner drop that than Prestige because the Gold restaurant benefit is a PITA.
