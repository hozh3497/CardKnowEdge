My internet and wireless phone bills were on autopay with a different card  So for the next 3 months, I just have to manually pay the bills with Freedom before autopay took place at the end of the month  It's about $300 x 3 months = $900   But I only get 900 x 2 = 1800 UR points extra because my autopay card is Chase Ink Preferred which gave 3x points on internet and phone   I guess 1800 points is better than nothing  I won't be getting gas as I only have EV cars    I used to get Amazon gift cards from 7/11 gas station, but now I have Amazon 5% card on the account, it doesn't really make sense to buy 5 UR points gift card in place of 5% cash."," I don't SPECTRUM existed 10 years ago under that name, did it?"," Does anybody know which gas stations in Tennessee sell VGC with CC? There is no 7-11 here I saw $500 VGCs at Pilot gas station, and they allowed me to buy it with CC, but it didn't pass through, I guess it's hardcoded Need to utilize my 6 Freedom cards this quarter It was a blast to buy VGCs at 7-11 in CA, but I moved."," In that case, you may want to update your FT Profile It still says SJC/SFO, which made me wonder why you were asking about Tennessee until I finished reading your post."," Why yes; they've used the name since the 80s You might be thinking of somebody else  Spectrum Entertainment Carnival"," Of course I'm thinking of somebody else: The company actually called Spectrum (no other words in the name): https://www.spectrum.net/ That company called exactly Spectrum is a merger of Charter Cable and Time Warner Cable, and so that's why I said I doubt it existed 10 years ago as exactly Spectrum Besides, while the website URL you gave just calls the company you're talking about \"Spectrum Entertianment\", the actual web page that pulls up just uses the name \"Spectrum Carnival\", with no mention of \"Entertainment\" being part of the name So they can't even seem to make up their minds as to what their own name is!"," Does using Chase pay at gas station qualify for gas station category? I would assume it would count since it's like using Apple pay at a merchant."," Don't see why it shouldn't Chase Pay is just a way to use your Chase card and doesn't impact what a merchant codes as."," Well buying GC's at gas stations continue to be problem for the Q1 2020 category In Q3 last year I was able to go to a local 7 Eleven and got the guy to let me buy an Amazon GC with my CF, no problem The other night I went to the same 7 Eleven and a different guy was working and said he couldnt do it unless it was cash or debit I asked why and that I had bought a GC there before, he just said that was what he was told By who and when? No Answer  I just dont understand this weird rule with Gas stations?! When home improvement is the category I can walk into any Lowes or Home Depot, go straight to the GC section, pick one up and go straight to the register and pay with my CF card and they dont even bat an eyelid"," Zero problem! What sort of fraud are they worried about, my name is on the credit card and I can show my I.D - What is the problem??? Are they operating under some urban myth of a scam that just isn't true?"," Yes, they are operating under an urban myth  It is called \u201cprofit.\u201d"," Profit for who? Gas station or credit card company?"," It doesn\u0092t really matter which one, or both  Neither wants a sale with no profit."," Well in the case of the gas station it could be that they dont want to pay the credit card transaction fee on a non-profit sale, but if so, why dont they just say that? They're usually franchises owned by a small business person so I get that However, none of the workers or managers there can seem to give a reason other than its some vague rule that they were told by someone Even with cash purchase of GC's are they making a profit? Why do gas stations carry GC's at all then? Do they in fact get a piece of a GC sale? I dont know but it would be interesting to find out"," In the case of the credit card company part of the reason I have one of their premium credit cards is for the points transfer perks It their cost of doing business and competing with other credit card issuers I didnt create the game I just play it If its their rule well then I guess some people are getting around it by searching for a gas station that doesnt care about either scenario The urban myth part of my comment above was that it seems that there is some feeling of it being a scam to buy GC's with a credit card which is false"," I suppose someone could steal a credit card and then immediately go make a big GC purchase but just a minimal amount of verification of identity would solve that concern."," Why would you expect a clerk in a gas station to understand (and be able or willing to explain to you) the owner\u0092s business model? The gas station owner has no reason to modify his/her business practices to facilitate your credit card spending goals As to your second point, it is extremely unlikely that your credit card issuer is the same company that is selling the gift cards  (and setting the rules) in the 7-11 store that you wandered into  They are different companies, with different motivations and different rules  The company selling the gift cards did not, in fact, issue you \u0093one of their premium credit cards\u0094 \u0097\u0097- even if they both say \u0093Visa\u0094 on the front."," To be fair, buying gift cards is a well known way of cashing out cloned credit cards Combine that with gas stations being one of the merchant categories with higher fraud rates (especially since most pumps are swipe only, not to mention that many didn't even get chip inside until recently), I'm not surprised a lot of gas stations don't approve."," Heads up: Apple Music doesn't trigger 5x points on Chase Freedom (and it should)    I just activated a Chase Freedom, and was expecting my monthly Apple Music charge to trigger the 5x point reward as Apple Music is listed under the \"select streaming service\" reward category for this quarter It only triggered the regular 1x point I'm assuming that's because the charge appears as \"Apple.com/bill\" on the statement, which doesn't suggest anything about Apple Music I called Chase to alert them -- this effectively removes Apple Music from the 5x reward category for all customers -- and the representative said they'll escalate the issue"," No clue how they'll fix this -- all recurring Apple charges appear under \"Apple.com/bill,\" blind to the service provided -- but anyway, figured I'd give folks a heads up if you want your Apple Music bill to be rewarded accordingly this quarter."," They didn't at least fix yours?   I contacted Chase one time for missing bonus and they gave me the same standard response saying it is the merchant's decision to select their category but they manually issue the points to me."," Since Apple Music is listed, Chase should be able to give you a manual credit There is no need to fix it as those manual credits won't count against your $1500 total."," Quote: Yes, they said they\u0092ll manually adjust the credit for me What I meant by \u0093fix\u0094 is how they\u0092ll make sure all customers can get 5x rewards for Apple Music if the charge itself doesn\u0092t trigger the reward, since it\u0092s a vague \u0093Apple bill\u0094 on the statement."," There seems to be some wonky category postings Payment made on the same portal (two different accounts) posted to different categories; although I believed the Jan 3 transaction initially had coded to \"Bills &amp;amp; Utilities\" before the switch, which is why I see still 5x despite the (updated) \"Entertainment\" category Jan 7, 2020 SPECTRUM Bills &amp;amp; Utilities Jan 3, 2010 SPECTRUM Entertainment Not on the Freedom card, but Sapphire had coded an obvious transit charge to the \"Shopping\" category."," Fee waived on first call!    I called the number on back of the card Spoke to a very upbeat and helpful gentleman who immediately understood why I had called He waived the fee after looking at the account It took just five minutes Very pleased with their agent, their app, no foreign transaction fee and ease of use of miles Spent $10-12K last year and will continue to use it to diversify from Chase and Amex points   akr1970akr likes this."," I get it, completely Generally, I never use Paypal but did so with my Freedom on WN flights originating from SFO (assuming it's hard to claim travel insurance from my home airport for \"reasonable expenses\" - you know, don't think that HMB Ritz idea of mine would pass the smell test) because of the rotating 5% thing Post 2008 (even before), we've been in the golden age of sign up bonuses here in the States that will unlikely be seen again for a long time once this is over People outside the US are now beginning to understand how great we've had it in this game for a very long time"," Here's the thing Even if we could pay for everything, why in the world would we subsidize the cheesers?
